    "# Introduction\n",
    "After the unveiling of Devin AI, I was curious to see if AI really had the capabilities to take our jobs. Specifically, can AI replace tech jobs such as Data Analysts, Software Engineers, etc. To test this I used the Claude Opus 3 model to answer mock interview questions generated by <a href = \"https://huru.ai/\">Huru AI.</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Huru AI requires you to record a video with your response, I had some initial concerns about the LLM's ability to understand that it was being interviewed with a two minute window to speak. Thus, I prompted it with the question folllowed by \"make the response two minutes long when spoken outloud,\" I am curious to see if it can really estimate what two minutes of speech is.\n",

    "## Question 1:  Can you walk me through a recent project where you designed and implemented a computer program from scratch?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Response: \n",
    "*nods* Absolutely. One recent project that comes to mind is a custom inventory management system I designed and implemented for a mid-sized e-commerce company.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company was struggling with their existing off-the-shelf solution, which couldn't handle their complex inventory tracking needs across multiple warehouses. They needed a tailored system that could provide real-time visibility, automate order fulfillment, and integrate seamlessly with their e-commerce platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started by conducting thorough requirements gathering sessions with stakeholders from various departments to understand their pain points and desired features. Based on these insights, I designed a scalable, modular architecture using a microservices approach with RESTful APIs for inter-service communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the backend, I chose Node.js with Express framework to build the API layer, leveraging its non-blocking I/O model for high concurrency. The inventory data was stored in a MongoDB database, chosen for its flexibility and ability to handle unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I implemented the core inventory tracking functionality, including real-time stock updates, low-stock alerts, and automated reordering based on predefined thresholds. The system also supported complex search and filtering capabilities to quickly locate specific items across multiple warehouses.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure data consistency and reliability, I incorporated transaction management, error handling, and data validation at critical points. I also designed an event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka to decouple the inventory system from the e-commerce platform, enabling seamless integration and real-time updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the front-end, I built an intuitive, responsive user interface using React and Material-UI components. The UI allowed warehouse managers to easily view, update, and manage inventory levels, as well as generate reports and insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the development process, I followed agile methodologies, working in sprints and collaborating closely with the client's team. **(WAS ONLY ABLE TO GET TO HERE UNTIL IT WAS CUT OFF)** \n",
    "\n",
    "I conducted regular code reviews, wrote comprehensive unit and integration tests, and ensured the codebase was maintainable and well-documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a series of iterative development cycles and thorough testing, the inventory management system was successfully deployed to production. It significantly streamlined the company's inventory tracking processes, reduced manual errors, and improved order fulfillment efficiency. The modular architecture also allowed for easy scalability and integration with future systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project showcased my ability to design and implement a robust, custom software solution from scratch, tailored to the client's specific business needs. It highlighted my skills in requirements gathering, system architecture, full-stack development, and project management.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Huru's Feedback:\n",
    "#### Accuracy of your answer\n",
    "Your response is excellent and articulates your skills, expertise, and approach to project execution in detail. You've done a great job providing a comprehensive walk-through of a recent project, explaining why specific technologies were chosen, outlining the problem you were solving, your methodology, and the resulting outcomes. One minor improvement could be mentioning any challenges you faced during the implementation phase and how you overcame them, as this could be an essential aspect interviewers may want to hear. Excellent job overall!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Speech and Grammar Analysis\n",
    "You provided a very detailed and thorough answer, which perfectly sets out your skills and expertise. However, there are some minor grammatical issues. Instead of \"conducting thorough requirements\", use \"conducting thorough requirements-gathering sessions\". Instead of \"closing with teams and clients\", use \"close collaboration with teams and clients\". Lastly, instead of \"wrote comprehensive unit integration tests\", it should be \"wrote comprehensive unit and integration tests\". Your use of technical jargon displays your knowledge, but make sure the interviewer can follow your traÄ±n of thought\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Speech quality and confidence\n",
    "Your answer comes across as confident and deep in detail. You show a clear understanding of your project and displayed very strong technical competency. You also show commendable control over your narrative, which is a reflection of a levelled confidence. Well done!\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Thoughts:\n",
    "I thought it was really interesting that the LLM \"nods\" at the start of the response, showing that maybe it misunderstood my prompt. It also seems like the LLM overestimated the amount of words I could speak in 2 minutes. I like Huru's analysis of the answer to question 1, but it seems like it misunderstood what I was saying at times."

    "## Question 2: How do you approach problem-solving when faced with complex programming issues? \n",
    "\n",
    "## Response:\n",
    "When faced with complex programming issues, my approach to problem-solving involves several key steps. First, I take the time to thoroughly understand the problem at hand, breaking it down into smaller, more manageable components. This allows me to identify the root cause of the issue and develop a clear picture of what needs to be addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I draw upon my experience and knowledge to consider potential solutions. I think about similar challenges I've encountered in the past and how I successfully resolved them. I also consider best practices and design patterns that could be applied to the current situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the problem is particularly complex or novel, I'm not afraid to conduct research and consult with colleagues or online resources to gather additional insights and perspectives. Collaborating with others often leads to innovative solutions that I may not have considered on my own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I have a few potential solutions in mind, I evaluate each one carefully, considering factors such as feasibility, performance, scalability, and maintainability. I weigh the pros and cons of each approach and select the one that best addresses the problem while aligning with the project's goals and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I implement the chosen solution incrementally, testing thoroughly at each stage to ensure that it effectively resolves the issue without introducing new problems. I document my work clearly so that others can understand and maintain the code in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the problem-solving process, I maintain a positive attitude and remain open to feedback and suggestions from others. I believe that continuous learning and adaptation are essential for success in the ever-evolving field of software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Huru's Feedback:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accuracy: \n",
    "Your answer provides a comprehensive understanding of your approach to problem-solving, especially when it comes to dealing with complex programming issues. It is commendable that you have demonstrated a systematic way of resolving these issues, from understanding the problem, considering potential solutions, evaluating each solution based on certain factors, to implementing the chosen solution. You've clearly shown your technical skills, critical thinking, and collaboration. Your emphasis on continuous learning, adaptation, and maintaining a positive attitude throughout the process is also beneficial in the workplace. Excellent job.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quality + Confidence:\n",
    "Your response was very thorough and displayed confidence. It showed you understand problem-solving processes well. However, it seemed slightly rehearsed and textbook-like. While clear and methodic, your response could have displayed more self-assurance, especially when discussing your ability to collaborate and adapt.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Speech and Grammar Analysis:\n",
    "Your response was comprehensive and well-structured, showcasing your problem-solving capabilities effectively. However, there are some areas where clarity can be improved. Instead of saying \"when it needs to be addressed,\" say \"what needs to be addressed,\" to establish clear specificity. Moreover, avoid redundant sentences like \"I document my work clearly so that I can understand and maintain the code in the future.\" It is assumed you will understand your own coding work without documentation, so say, \"I document my work clearly for future reference and ease of maintenance.\" Lastly, instead of saying \"I believe that this continuous learning and adaptation are essential for our success,\" say \"I believe that continuous learning and adaptation are essential for success.\" This simplifies your statement and removes any confusion or ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thoughts\n",
    "This response was a little better in terms of time, I was able to say it all in 1 minute and 30 seconds. I also thought that the analysis was good but still has similar issues of misunderstanding what I said. "

    "\n",
    "#### Thoughts\n",
    "Overall, I thought that the answer was solid but I agree that the answer was quite long. It took me 1 minute and 56 seconds to speak it. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Concluding Thoughts\n",
    "Overall I liked both the Opus model's responses as well as Huru AI's evaluations. But overall, the responses to the interview questions were really long and didn't sound natural. I want to see in the future if using different models could make these answers more consise. When it comes down to it, I feel that Software Engineers have a bit of time before AI can take over their jobs. While the Opus model was able to come up with these responses, at the end of the day, we will always need a human to collaborate, verify information with, and ensure the job gets done the right way."
