    "# Sports Analytics as a Communicative Context\n",
    "## What is a Sports Analyst?\n",
    "According to Teal, a Sports Analyst is someone who analyzes data and utilizes statistics to interpret and communicate insights to various members of an organization. They can have an influence on game strategy as well as player trades and signings. These analysts can also use their findings to make changes to help an organization change its business strategies. Specifically, they can influence marketing strategies, fan engagement, and financial decisions <cite id=\"px6x6\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FU9CMDEDA\">(<i>What Is a Sports Analyst?</i>, n.d.)</a></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different concentrations among sports analysts. The two main types of analysts that we will explore in this project are Scouting Analysts and Game Analysts. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Scouting Analysts\n",
    "Scouting Analysts evaluate and seek talent for their organizations. They mainly analyze statistics and videos and use traditional scouting methods to evaluate athletes. These analysts consider not only raw talent but also how these players fit within their team’s schemes and systems<cite id=\"3m0t3\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FWVE6MNJD\">(Drapkin, 2024)</a></cite>. Their findings are often presented in terms of scouting reports to General Managers and decision makers for the organization. They often collaborate with the scouting team to provide quantitative metrics for the scouts’ observations<cite id=\"znyhr\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FWVE6MNJD\">(Drapkin, 2024)</a></cite>. \n",
    "\n",
    "These analysts are especially valuable for organizations that value recruitment through trades and free agency, such as basketball, football, and baseball teams. Throughout the project, we will discuss the implications of LLMs for strategic analysts for basketball teams <cite id=\"1e66l\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FU9CMDEDA\">(<i>What Is a Sports Analyst?</i>, n.d.)</a></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game Analysts\n",
    "Game Analysts focus on game strategy. They analyze previous games and scout opponents to develop game plans and strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "They often examine player and team tendencies, look for key matchups, and strive to create winning strategies. They provide these insights in the form of reports to the coaching staff<cite id=\"3zcdn\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FWVE6MNJD\">(Drapkin, 2024)</a></cite>. A huge part of their job is tailoring their findings so that the coaching staff will find it useful and often have to reformat their findings to allow the coaches to get the most out of it. This usually involves creating data visualizations and data tables to clearly communicate their data<cite id=\"z92py\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FWVE6MNJD\">(Drapkin, 2024)</a></cite>. \n",
    "\n",
    "These analysts are crucial for basketball and football, where in-game adjustments can be the difference between winning and losing <cite id=\"wmqdb\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FU9CMDEDA\">(<i>What Is a Sports Analyst?</i>, n.d.)</a></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Focus of the Project\n",
    "For the rest of the project, we will explore how LLMs can help these two types of Analysts in basketball organizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?\n",
    "A LLM is a type of Artificial Intelligence that specializes in recognizing and creating text. <cite id=\"6xzoy\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FX8X462Z3\">(<i>What Is a Large Language Model (LLM)?</i>, n.d.)</a></cite>. Large Language models are built using a transformer model (a neural network) that has been trained on a lot of data <cite id=\"1cnii\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FYX778JRR\">(<i>What Are Large Language Models (LLMs)?</i>, 2024)</a></cite>. \n",
    "\n",
    "These transformer models are type of neural network that is able to learn from the context it’s provided <cite id=\"1oyfs\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FX8X462Z3\">(<i>What Is a Large Language Model (LLM)?</i>, n.d.)</a></cite>. They are able to understand how sentences are connected and how text relates to each other. What makes them really powerful is that they understand the semantic meanings of text, and can associate words and concepts with their meaning <cite id=\"n4lg4\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FX8X462Z3\">(<i>What Is a Large Language Model (LLM)?</i>, n.d.)</a></cite>. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths \n",
    "LLMs are really great at responding to questions. They can understand human language and provide an answer. The way they do this is by learning patterns of language and predicting the next word in a sentence <cite id=\"bzfe6\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2F6NJJPC72\">(shanepeckham, 2024)</a></cite>. This makes them specifically useful when generating text. However, with tasks that require logical, advanced, and fact-based answers, these LLMs can struggle <cite id=\"dro3t\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2F6NJJPC72\">(shanepeckham, 2024)</a></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaknesses\n",
    "LLMs are known to hallucinate. It is important to know this and to always take the responses from an LLM with a grain of salt. It’s really important that these models are trained on true data, as these LLMs really hallucinate when they are given incorrect information. When using LLMs it’s really important to know these strengths and weaknesses. LLMs often generate confident responses, but their answers might not always be accurate<cite id=\"bqnyr\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2F6NJJPC72\">(shanepeckham, 2024)</a></cite>. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Sports and LLMs Currently\n",
    "Talking about sports is very complicated. There are various strategies, statistics, and general knowledge that one must know to truly discuss a sport <cite id=\"4s9uu\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FA7PNLSS5\">(Xia et al., 2024)</a></cite>. At the moment LLMs have shown that it can process and understand language, extract information, and answer questions. However, at the moment it struggles to answer complicated sports questions. This is mainly because of sports as a language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sports as a Language\n",
    "When we talk about sports, we often use terms that we've picked up on from watching or playing the sport. These terms are often unknown to those that are unfamilar with the sport and can cause confusion. For example, if I wanted to talk about someone was going for a layup and got fouled when shooting, I would call that an \"And-one.\" To those who are familar with this term, they wouldn't need this explanation. However, it can be very confusing to those who do not understand basketball and its rules, let alone the jargon associated with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "This sport jargon has been created by athletes as a way to communicate <cite id=\"tn9ct\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2F7XBW5JWB\">(Kowalikowa, n.d.)</a></cite>. This sports jargon is often used as a way to communicate to others what actions need to be completed<cite id=\"nncda\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2F7XBW5JWB\">(Kowalikowa, n.d.)</a></cite>. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, calling for a \"pick\" in basketball is when an offensive player stands still to the side of their teammate's defender. If done right, the defensive player will be stuck on the person setting the \"pick.\" This allows the teammate to gain space from the defender and score the ball. When somebody (the sender) calls for a pick in basketball, they are assuming that the person they are communicating this to (the receiver) understands this information, and thus can refer to this term without explaining the whole process to them <cite id=\"9kj98\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2F7XBW5JWB\">(Kowalikowa, n.d.)</a></cite>. \n",
    "\n",
    "**However, research is currently being conducted to allow for allow LLMs and Sports Analytics be more connected in the future.** \n",
    "\n",
    "# Current Research in LLMs and Sports Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "### SportQA: A Benchmark to Improve LLM Understanding of Sports\n",
    "SportQA aims to help LLMs gain a better understanding in sports knowledge. Through their research, they hope to allow LLMs to answer more complicated problems about sports rather than simply fact-based questions<cite id=\"nwj4g\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FA7PNLSS5\">(Xia et al., 2024)</a></cite>. Specifically, SportsQA is a large dataset that was created to test an LLM's knowledge of sports by often shuffling players from various sports and plays from different sports to see if the LLM can really understand sports<cite id=\"zg6t9\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FA7PNLSS5\">(Xia et al., 2024)</a></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dataset, there are three different types of questions. The first is \"foundational knowledge\" which assesses the LLM's basic understanding of sports and focuses more on fact-based questions. The second type is \"rules and tactics comprehension,\" which involves asking the LLM to understand sports rules and strategies. The last type is \"advanced scenario-based understanding,\" these questions ask the LLM to analyze real sports situations<cite id=\"kuchd\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FA7PNLSS5\">(Xia et al., 2024)</a></cite>. \n",
    "\n",
    "By asking the LLMs these questions, SportsQA hopes to establish a benchmark for testing an LLM's understanding of sports. Overall, their founds showed that the models show promise for understanding facts, rules, and foundational knowledge in sports, but their skills in complicated sports questions are still very limited. Their findings show the need for greater research in Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence to allow LLMs to have a better understanding of sports. \n",
    "\n",
    "### SportsSett: A Solution to Sports and Natural Language Generation\n",
    "It seems that there are some improvements being made to the interactions of LLMs with basketball and sports analytics. Specifically, they're aiming to fix the issues associated with Natural Language Generation (NLG) and creating basketball game summaries<cite id=\"wg2p9\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FUWYAU6PB\">(Thomson et al., 2020)</a></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper points to the current resources available and how these datasets lack the data needed for generating summaries using advanced data analytics. A useful resource that exists is called the \"Rotowire and Rotowire-FG datasets.<cite id=\"stqoj\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FUWYAU6PB\">(Thomson et al., 2020)</a></cite>\" These datasets contain game summaries, box scores, and statistics to supplement the game summaries. While they contain a large amount of data, there are some limitations to these datasets <cite id=\"o333t\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FUWYAU6PB\">(Thomson et al., 2020)</a></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are many issues with these two datasets. The proposed solution is a new dataset called \"SportsSett.\" This dataset stores game statistics in a hierarchal structure, which allows the data to be queried from multiple dimensions. This structure will help allow for a richer \"entity-relationship graph <cite id=\"vnj2p\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FUWYAU6PB\">(Thomson et al., 2020)</a></cite>.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Existing Issues with Rotowire and Rotowire-FG\n",
    "The researchers who created SportsSett explained that there are issues with the existing Rotowire and Rotowire-FG datasets in terms of the data structure, availability, and length. In addition, the dataset lacks data on playoff games and preseason games. SportsSett seeks to solve these issues through data cleaning and redesign of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SportsSett database hopes to also expand upon the data by adding information such as stadium name and location. This is because, in basketball, home-court advantage and constant traveling can have very real effects on NBA teams. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Future Uses of LLMs in Sports Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that LLMs can be used in Sports Analytics. Given overall improvements to the LLMs’ understanding of sports, I believe that there are three main forms of content creation that LLMs could excel at. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first is video analysis. I feel that LLMs could be able to accurately analyze videos in the future. Specifically, I feel like LLMs could really provide value to these analysts by finding patterns in the data and describing them. It is really important that the LLM is able to describe the strengths and weaknesses of a player or team strictly based on video. This would allow the analysts to support their data with real-life examples and allow the team to make more informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second is player evaluation. I believe that the LLM will also be able to create comparisons and summaries of various players. In addition, a huge aspect of scouting analytics is being able to quantify fit. If the LLM could conduct this by looking at videos, reports, and statistics, I feel like there could be a lot of value for Sports Analysts as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I think LLMs could really excel at generating reports. In particular, the LLM could help synthesize information from the scouts with statistics from the analysts. This would allow for customizable reports that contain accurate information from all parties. I think these reports could be used for scouting and game analysis, where draft reports and game strategy reports could both be generated. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will be exploring these three types of content generation in the next [next section.](Exploring_LLMs.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exploring\n",
    "# My Exploration\n",
    "Through out this section, I will be exploring how LLMs can be used in the context of scouting analytics. Specfically I will be walking the Gemini 1.5 Pro model through the scenario of an NBA draft. In this scenario I will be using Gemini 1.5 Pro to conduct video analysis, player evaluation, and generating reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through out the exploration we will be telling the LLM that it is a scout for the Philadelphia 76ers back in 2017. They will be determining what player they would like to pick with the first pick of the 2017 NBA draft. In real life, this is also true, as the Philadelphia 76ers traded up to the first pick. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Player Evaluation - Scouting Analysts\n",
    "I wanted to see how the Gemini 1.5 Pro model would handle player evaluations. This is traditionally a task completed by the Scouting Analysts for a team. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Data for Draft Analysis\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "Continue to pretend that you are a scout for the Philadelphia 76ers. You have the first pick in the 2017 NBA draft this year. Conduct an in-depth analysis of all three of these players and explain which of the three you would like to draft. \n",
    "Compare and contrast each players strengths and weaknesses and explain why you want to draft that prospect in specific\n",
    "You will be provided with their position, height, weight and stats from their college careers. \n",
    "\n",
    "(I attached the [data](data/draft_data.txt) here in the prompt) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "> Evaluating Three Top Prospects for the 76ers\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Based on the provided information, the three players under consideration appear to be:\n",
    "> \n",
    ">Player 1: Markelle Fultz (Washington, Guard)\n",
    "> \n",
    ">Player 2: Lonzo Ball (UCLA, Guard)\n",
    "> \n",
    ">Player 3: Jayson Tatum (Duke, Forward)\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Let's dive into a deeper analysis of each player, comparing their strengths and weaknesses to determine the best fit for the Philadelphia 76ers with the first pick in the 2017 NBA Draft.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Player 1: Markelle Fultz\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Strengths: Fultz is the most well-rounded offensive player of the three. He boasts impressive scoring versatility, shooting efficiently from both inside and outside the arc. His 47.6% field goal percentage and 41.3% three-point percentage showcase his ability to score at all three levels. Additionally, his 5.9 assists per game highlight his playmaking skills and potential to be a primary ball-handler.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">Weaknesses: His defensive stats, while decent, don't stand out as much as his offensive prowess. He averaged 1.6 steals and 1.2 blocks per game, suggesting he has the potential to be a solid defender but may need to improve his consistency and effort on that end.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Player 2: Lonzo Ball\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Strengths: Ball is an elite passer and floor general. His 7.6 assists per game lead the pack, demonstrating his exceptional court vision and ability to elevate his teammates. He's also a good rebounder for his position, averaging 6.0 rebounds per game, which would aid the 76ers in transition opportunities.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Weaknesses: Ball's shooting is a major concern. While his 55.1% field goal percentage looks good, his 41.2% three-point percentage is less impressive when considering his unorthodox shooting form and potential for inconsistency. His lower steals and blocks averages also raise questions about his defensive impact at the NBA level.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Player 3: Jayson Tatum\n",
    ">Strengths: Tatum is a gifted scorer with a knack for creating his own shot. He demonstrates impressive efficiency inside the arc with a 50.4% two-point percentage. His 84.9% free throw percentage suggests a smooth shooting stroke and potential for improvement beyond the arc. Additionally, he shows promise as a defender with 1.3 steals and 1.1 blocks per game.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Weaknesses: Compared to Fultz and Ball, Tatum's playmaking is less developed, averaging only 2.1 assists per game. While he can create for himself, he might not be the ideal primary ball-handler the 76ers need.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**Draft Recommendation: Markelle Fultz**\n",
    "> Considering the 76ers' need for a player who can create offense and be a cornerstone for the future, Markelle Fultz stands out as the best choice for the first pick. His well-rounded offensive skillset, shooting efficiency, and playmaking ability make him the ideal complement to Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid. While his defense needs some development, his offensive potential and fit within the team outweigh this concern.\n",
    "> Ball's passing is phenomenal, but his shooting inconsistencies and potential fit issues with Simmons make him a riskier selection. Tatum's scoring prowess is impressive, but his lack of elite playmaking makes him less valuable to the 76ers' specific needs.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Therefore, I confidently recommend drafting Markelle Fultz with the first pick. His potential to be a superstar and the perfect fit alongside Simmons and Embiid make him the ideal choice to lead the 76ers to long-term success.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thoughts**\n",
    "It was really shocking to me that the LLM knew the name of the players I provided the data for. The Gemini 1.5 Pro model was able to correctly keep track of all the statistics I told it, and described all of the players' stats correctly. This accuracy seems almost too good to be true, which makes me think that the model is relying on its internet access rather than its knowledge from the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Following up with Gemini\n",
    "I then decided to ask it, how it knew the players' names.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt:** \n",
    "How did you know the players names, I did not provide them?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "You are absolutely right, you didn't explicitly provide the names of the players. However, based on the information you provided about their positions, heights, weights, and college statistics, I was able to make an educated guess that the players were Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball, and Jayson Tatum. These three players were widely considered the top prospects in the 2017 NBA Draft, and their statistics align with the data you provided. I apologize if this caused any confusion. As a large language model, I am trained on a massive dataset of text and code, which allows me to make connections and inferences based on the information provided. However, I am still under development and learning to be more precise in my responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thoughts**\n",
    "This response checks out, but I still beleive that it is relying on its access to the internet to make these analyses and statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preventing Searching\n",
    "To prevent the model from relying purely on the internet for its answers, I attempted to remove any possible traits that the model could use to identify the players. Thus I removed the confrence and school columns from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "Evaluate three players. Pretend that you are a scout for the Philadelphia 76ers. You have the first pick in the 2017 NBA draft this year. Conduct an in-depth analysis of all three of these players and explain which of the three you would like to draft. \n",
    "Compare and contrast each players strengths and weaknesses and explain why you want to draft that prospect in specific\n",
    "You will be provided with their position, height, weight and stats from their college careers. \n",
    "\n",
    "(I attached the [new data](data/new_draft_data.txt) here in the prompt) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "> 2017 NBA Draft Evaluation for the Philadelphia 76ers\n",
    "> \n",
    ">Holding the first pick in the draft, the 76ers need a player who can contribute immediately and become a cornerstone for the franchise's future. Let's analyze the three prospects:\n",
    ">Player 1:\n",
    ">Strengths: High scoring guard with a well-rounded offensive game. Efficient scorer inside the arc, decent 3-point shooter, and excellent free throw shooter. Good passer and rebounder for his position.\n",
    ">Weaknesses: 3-point shooting consistency is a concern. Turnover rate is a bit high. Played against weaker competition (lower SOS).\n",
    ">Summary: Player 1 has the potential to be a lead scorer in the NBA, but his outside shooting and decision-making need improvement.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Player 2:\n",
    ">Strengths: Tall guard with excellent size and scoring ability. Highly efficient scorer both inside and outside the arc. Good rebounder and passer. Plays with good pace and control.\n",
    ">Weaknesses: Free throw percentage could be better. Doesn't generate many steals or blocks.\n",
    ">Summary: Player 2 is a skilled scorer with great size for his position. He projects as a high-level combo guard with the potential to be a star.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">Player 3:\n",
    ">Strengths: Versatile forward with good size and athleticism. Efficient scorer around the basket, decent shooter from mid-range, and an excellent free throw shooter. Good rebounder and defender.\n",
    ">Weaknesses: 3-point shooting needs improvement for a modern forward. Turnover rate is a bit high.\n",
    "Summary: Player 3 is a solid all-around player with the potential to be a reliable starter.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **Recommendation: Draft Player 2**\n",
    "> Player 2 stands out as the best choice for the 76ers for several reasons:\n",
    "> Elite Scoring Potential: His efficiency and versatility as a scorer, both inside and outside, make him a constant threat on offense.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Size and Positional Versatility: His 6'6\" height allows him to play both guard positions, providing flexibility and matchup advantages.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Playmaking Ability: He demonstrates good court vision and passing skills, which is crucial for a lead guard.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> High Ceiling: He possesses the talent and skills to become a star player in the NBA.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">While his free throw shooting and defensive stats could improve, his strengths outweigh these concerns. Player 2 has the potential to be the franchise player the 76ers desperately need. He can contribute immediately while growing into a leader on and off the court.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">Player 1 and Player 3 are both talented prospects, but they don't offer the same combination of size, scoring ability, and >playmaking as Player 2. Choosing Player 2 gives the 76ers the best chance to build a successful team for the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thoughts**\n",
    "Without the context before, the model chose a different player. Player 2 is Lonzo Ball (actual 2nd pick in the 2017 Draft) instead of Markelle Fultz (their actual 1st pick in the draft). I really like its analysis. It seems to really make good points such as strength of schedule (SOS) for the first prospect as well as the general skillsets for all the players. Overall I **really** like this response.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Considering Context\n",
    "A huge aspect of a scouting analyst's success is their ability to identify fit within a team. I wanted to see if the model could correctly identify this as well. I also wanted to see if after considering these variables, would it change its decision?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "Make sure to consider this player's strengths and weaknesses as well as your team's strengths and weaknesses. Do you still want to draft this player.\n",

    "**Response**\n",
    ">You're right, drafting needs to consider both the player's individual attributes AND the team's existing strengths and weaknesses. Let's re-evaluate Player 2 in the context of the 2017 Philadelphia 76ers:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**76ers Situation (2017):**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Strengths: Young, promising core with Ben Simmons (point forward), Joel Embiid (center) coming off injury, and Dario Saric.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Weaknesses: Lack of perimeter shooting, consistent scoring outside of Embiid (when healthy), and experienced ball-handling.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Player 2 Reconsidered:\n",
    ">Fits a Need: While NOT a pure shooter, his scoring versatility and size at the guard spot address the 76ers' need for another offensive weapon. He could play alongside Simmons, taking some ball-handling pressure off and creating a potent 1-2 punch.\n",
    "Potential Overlap: Both Simmons and Player 2 are at their best with the ball in their hands. While their skills are complementary, Coach Brown would need to design an offense that maximizes both players without hindering either.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Defensive Fit: The 76ers' defense is anchored by Embiid, and Simmons has the potential to be a versatile defender. Player 2's defense is more of a question mark.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Revised Decision:\n",
    ">Given the 76ers' specific needs, drafting Player 2 remains a strong option, BUT with a more cautious outlook:\n",
    "Offensive Fit is Key: The success of this pick hinges on Player 2 and Simmons meshing well offensively. If their games don't complement each other, the 76ers' spacing could suffer, limiting their offensive ceiling.\n",
    "Development is Crucial: Player 2's defense and off-ball play need work to maximize his fit. The 76ers' coaching staff would have a significant role in shaping his development.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Alternatives:\n",
    "Pure Shooter: If the 76ers prioritize perimeter shooting above all else, other prospects in the 2017 draft might be a better fit (though they might lack Player 2's star potential).\n",
    "Trade Down: Exploring a trade to acquire multiple assets or a player who's a more proven shooter could also be a viable strategy.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Conclusion:\n",
    "Drafting Player 2 is STILL a justifiable choice for the 76ers, but it comes with more risk than initially assessed. His fit with Simmons will determine his success, and his development is crucial for him to reach his full potential in Philadelphia. The 76ers should carefully weigh this decision against other options, considering both the player's talent and the team's specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thoughts**\n",
    "I also **really** like this response. The players that the model cited were all on the team in 2017 and its analysis of each players different strengths and weakenesses were also correct. I also like it citing the potential conflict in playing styles between Lonzo Ball (player 2) and Ben Simmons. This is a very, very good insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reprompting: Was it Using the Internet All Along?\n",
    "Just to make sure the model wasn't replicating history and using the top three prospects from the 2017 NBA draft class, I reprompted it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "Based on the 2017 draft class, who do you think player 1,2,and 3 are? Explain your thought process and reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    ">Based on the stats provided and your description of the 2017 draft class, here's my best guess for the players' identities:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Player 2: Markelle Fultz\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Reasoning: The combination of size (6'6\"), scoring ability (high FG% both inside and outside), and playmaking potential strongly suggests Markelle Fultz. He was touted as a potential superstar with a well-rounded offensive game. The slightly low free throw percentage (67.3%) also aligns with Fultz's profile.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Player 3: Jonathan Isaac\n",
    "Reasoning: The description of a \"versatile forward\" with decent shooting but needing improvement from three-point range points towards Jonathan Isaac. His size (6'8\") and solid rebounding numbers further support this. He was known for his defensive potential and athleticism more than his offensive polish at that stage.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Player 1: Dennis Smith Jr.\n",
    "Reasoning: The profile of a scoring guard with good passing but concerns about 3-point consistency and turnovers leads me to Dennis Smith Jr. He was an explosive athlete with a knack for getting to the rim. His size (6'4\") also aligns with this guess.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Additional Notes:\n",
    "It's important to acknowledge that this is speculation based on limited information. Other players from the 2017 draft might have similar stat lines.\n",
    "Player 1's low \"SOS\" (Strength of Schedule) is a bit tricky. It could indicate playing against weaker competition, but it wasn't a major talking point for any of the top guards in that draft.\n",
    "Let me know what you think! Does this analysis match up with your intended players?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thoughts**\n",
    "These were not the players I used. Player 1 was actually Markelle Fultz (not player 2), Player 2 was Lonzo Ball, and Player 3 was Jayson Tatum. Although it was not correct, in a way this is very good. It proves to me that the model wasn't trying to replicate history, but rather it was truly considering the statistics I was giving it. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Video Analysis - Scouting Analysts\n",
    "I then wanted to see how the Gemini 1.5 Pro model would perform in analyzing videos. I provided it ~10 minute clips for the same three prospects. I created a new prompt so the previous context wouldn't transfer over. This task is usually completed by both the scouting team and scouting analysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prospect 1: Markelle Fultz\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "Pretend that you are a scout for the Philadelphia 76ers. You have the first pick in the 2017 NBA draft this year. Conduct an in-depth analysis of this player and whether you would like to draft him and explain why.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then attached this video:\n",
    "<a href = \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m3T1fHW6j8&t=79s\"> Markelle Fultz Highlights </a>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    ">Strengths:\n",
    ">Offensive Versatility: Fultz is a dynamic scorer with the ability to create his own shot, drive to the basket, and knock down outside jumpers. His jump shot is smooth and efficient, and he possesses a variety of finishes around the rim. This versatility makes him a tough matchup for any defender.\n",
    ">Playmaking: Fultz demonstrates excellent court vision and passing ability. He can facilitate for teammates, create opportunities for others, and make the right reads in pick-and-roll situations. His playmaking skills would be a valuable asset to any team, especially one like the 76ers who need a player who can create offense.\n",
    ">Athleticism: Fultz is a fluid athlete with good size and length for a guard. He can finish above the rim, move well laterally on defense, and has the potential to be a lockdown defender at the next level.\n",
    ">Potential: At just 19 years old, Fultz possesses immense potential and is considered one of the most talented players in the draft. His combination of scoring, playmaking, and athleticism suggests he has the potential to be a superstar in the NBA.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Weaknesses:\n",
    ">Competition Level: Fultz played his college ball at the University of Washington, which wasn't a powerhouse program. The lack of elite competition raises questions about how his skills will translate to the NBA.\n",
    ">Defense: While Fultz has the physical tools to be a good defender, he needs to improve his consistency and effort on this end of the floor.\n",
    ">Three-Point Shooting Consistency: Although his jump shot form is solid, his three-point shooting percentages in college were not elite. Ensuring he develops consistency from beyond the arc will be important for maximizing his offensive potential.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Fit with the 76ers:\n",
    "Fultz would be an ideal fit for the Philadelphia 76ers. The team desperately needs a playmaker and scorer who can take some of the pressure off of Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid. Fultz's ability to create his own shot and facilitate for others would make him a perfect complement to Simmons's passing and Embiid's inside presence. His potential to develop into a two-way star aligns perfectly with the 76ers' timeline for contention.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Draft Recommendation:\n",
    "Considering his elite offensive skillset, high ceiling, and ideal fit with the team's needs and young core, I strongly recommend that the Philadelphia 76ers select Markelle Fultz with the first pick in the 2017 NBA Draft. He has the potential to be a franchise-altering player and could be the missing piece that propels the 76ers into championship contention.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thoughts**\n",
    "I am pretty happy with this reponse. I specifically like how the model talked about fit with other players, even though I didn't explicitly ask for it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prospect 2: Jayson Tatum \n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "Continue to pretend that you are a scout for the Philadelphia 76ers. You have the first pick in the 2017 NBA draft this year. Conduct an in-depth analysis of this player and whether you would like to draft him and explain why. Please compare and contrast him to Markelle Fultz and whether you would like to select him instead of Fultz.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then provided this video: <a href = \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLqHSJhmLDI&pp=ygUTamF5c29uIHRhdHVtIGNvbGVnZQ%3D%3D \"> Jayson Tatum Highlights </a>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:** \n",
    ">Strengths:\n",
    ">Scoring Ability: Tatum is a polished scorer with a diverse offensive repertoire. He can create his own shot off the dribble, knock down mid-range jumpers, and finish at the rim with finesse and athleticism. His footwork and ability to create space are impressive, making him a difficult player to guard.\n",
    ">Size and Length: Standing at 6'8\" with a 6'11\" wingspan, Tatum has the size and length to be a mismatch at the small forward position. This allows him to shoot over smaller defenders and be disruptive on the defensive end.\n",
    ">Basketball IQ: Tatum demonstrates a high basketball IQ with good decision-making skills and a strong understanding of the game. He plays within himself and rarely forces bad shots.\n",
    ">Defensive Potential: With his physical tools and basketball IQ, Tatum has the potential to be a very good defender in the NBA. He can guard multiple positions and has shown the ability to be a disruptive force on this end of the floor.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Weaknesses:\n",
    "Playmaking: Compared to Fultz, Tatum's playmaking ability is not as developed. While he can create for himself, his passing and court vision are not as elite as Fultz's.\n",
    "Athleticism: Although Tatum is a good athlete, he's not as explosive or quick as Fultz. This could limit his ability to blow by defenders and finish at the rim against elite NBA athletes.\n",
    "Three-Point Shooting Consistency: Similar to Fultz, Tatum needs to improve his consistency from three-point range. He shot a decent percentage in college but will need to become a more reliable threat from beyond the arc to maximize his offensive impact.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Fit with the 76ers:\n",
    "Tatum would be a good fit with the Philadelphia 76ers, but not as ideal as Fultz. He would provide another scoring option alongside Embiid and Simmons, but his lack of elite playmaking skills might create some redundancy with Simmons's role as the primary ball-handler. However, his size and defensive potential would be valuable assets to the team.\n",
    "Comparison to Fultz and Draft Recommendation:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Both Fultz and Tatum are exceptional talents with the potential to be stars in the NBA. However, Fultz's superior playmaking ability and better fit with the 76ers' current roster make him the more attractive option with the first pick. Tatum's scoring and size are valuable, but the team's greater need for a player who can create offense makes Fultz the better choice in this scenario.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">If the 76ers were to trade down in the draft or acquire another high lottery pick, then selecting Tatum would be a great option. He has the potential to be a very good player in the NBA, but in the specific context of the 76ers and their needs with the first pick, Fultz remains the more optimal selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thoughts**\n",
    "I think the model also did a good job with the analysis here in terms of strengths, weaknesses, and fit. I think the comparison was really good and was pretty ironic. Back in 2017, the 76ers swapped first-round picks with the Boston Celtics to attain the 1st overall pick instead of the 3rd overall that they previously had. The 76ers ended up drafting Markelle Fultz and the Celtics drafted Jayson Tatum. The rest is history...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prospect 3: Lonzo Ball\n",
    "I continued the same process for Lonzo Ball. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "Continue to pretend that you are a scout for the Philadelphia 76ers. You have the first pick in the 2017 NBA draft this year. Conduct an in-depth analysis of this player and whether you would like to draft him and explain why. Please compare and contrast him to Markelle Fultz and Jayson Tatum (the previous two candidates) and whether you would like to select him (Lonzo Ball) instead of the other two prospects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provided video: <a href = \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOpz8IKutKY&t=448s\"> Lonzo Ball Highlights </a>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:** \n",
    "> Strengths:\n",
    ">Elite Passing and Court Vision: Ball is arguably the best passer in the draft, with exceptional court vision and a knack for making highlight-reel assists. He thrives in transition and pushes the pace, creating easy scoring opportunities for teammates.\n",
    "Basketball IQ: Similar to Tatum, Ball possesses a high basketball IQ and makes smart decisions with the ball. He understands spacing and timing, and his unselfish play makes him a natural leader on the court.\n",
    "Rebounding: For a guard, Ball is a very good rebounder. This allows him to initiate fast breaks and contribute on both ends of the floor.\n",
    "Shooting Potential: Ball has shown flashes of being a capable shooter, particularly off the dribble. His shooting form is unorthodox but can be effective.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">Weaknesses:\n",
    "Shooting Consistency: While Ball has potential as a shooter, his consistency is a major concern. His unorthodox form can lead to erratic shooting performances, and he struggles at times with his shot selection.\n",
    "Athleticism and Finishing: Compared to Fultz and Tatum, Ball is not as explosive or athletic. He can struggle to finish at the rim against length and athleticism, and his lack of elite quickness might be a liability on the defensive end.\n",
    "Defense: While Ball has good size and instincts, his lack of lateral quickness can be exposed on defense, especially against quicker guards. He will need to improve his defensive awareness and effort to be a reliable defender at the NBA level.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">Fit with the 76ers:\n",
    "Ball's elite passing and court vision would be a welcome addition to the 76ers, but his fit alongside Ben Simmons is questionable. Both players excel with the ball in their hands, and there might be some overlap in their skillsets. However, Ball's ability to push the pace and create easy baskets for teammates, especially shooters like JJ Redick, could be a valuable asset.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">Comparison to Fultz and Tatum and Draft Recommendation:\n",
    ">All three players – Fultz, Tatum, and Ball – are highly talented prospects with unique strengths and weaknesses. Fultz remains the most well-rounded of the three, with his combination of scoring, playmaking, and athleticism. Tatum offers polished scoring and defensive potential, while Ball provides elite passing and court vision.\n",
    "Given the 76ers' current roster construction and need for a player who can create offense, Fultz remains the top recommendation for the first pick. However, Ball's unique skillset and potential to be a transformative playmaker should not be overlooked. If the team prioritizes passing and court vision above all else and feels confident in Ball's shooting development, then selecting him over Fultz could be a viable option. However, the potential fit issues with Simmons and the concerns regarding Ball's shooting consistency make this a riskier selection compared to Fultz.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thoughts**\n",
    "I really like this analysis too. I think the fit answer was appropriate. Noneoftheless, I would have loved to see Lonzo Ball in a Sixers jersey.\n",

    "# Generating Reports - Game Analyst\n",
    "This task is traditionally completed by the Game Analysts of a team, I was curious to see if the model could correctly make game strategies from the perspective of a specific team. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "Pretend that you are the coach for Xavier basketball, this is your team's stats in the form of a csv. You are playing the Villanova Wildcats (second csv) next week and are instructed to create an in-depth scouting report on how to beat them. This is their teams stats in the form of a csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data: [Xavier v. Villanova Data](data/xavier_villanova.txt)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "> Villanova's Strengths:\n",
    "Efficient Shooting: Villanova boasts a 57.6% True Shooting percentage and a 56.5% Effective Field Goal percentage, indicating their proficiency in scoring. Shane Clark (81.5% TS%) and Dante Cunningham (101.3% TS%) are particularly efficient scorers.\n",
    "Offensive Rebounding: With a 27.3% Offensive Rebound percentage, Villanova excels at generating second-chance opportunities. Dante Cunningham and Curtis Sumpter are their primary threats on the offensive glass.\n",
    "Shot Blocking: Villanova's interior defense is anchored by Will Sheridan and Dante Cunningham, who contribute significantly to their 14.6% block percentage.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Villanova's Weaknesses:\n",
    ">Turnovers: Villanova's 21.8% Turnover rate suggests a vulnerability to ball pressure and defensive schemes that force mistakes. Scottie Reynolds and Reggie Redding are particularly prone to turnovers.\n",
    "Three-Point Reliance: While efficient from beyond the arc, Villanova's high 42.6% 3-point attempt rate means they rely heavily on outside shooting. Limiting open looks from three, especially for Shane Clark, should be a priority.\n",
    "Defensive Rebounding: Despite their strong offensive rebounding, Villanova's defensive rebounding percentage is only 70.4%, indicating potential opportunities for Xavier on the boards.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Strategies for Xavier:\n",
    ">Pressure Defense: Implementing a full-court press or aggressive half-court traps could exploit Villanova's turnover issues. Targeting Scottie Reynolds and Reggie Redding with pressure could disrupt their offensive flow.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Perimeter Defense: Limiting open three-point attempts, especially from Shane Clark, is crucial. Deny catch-and-shoot opportunities and force Villanova to work inside the arc.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">Crash the Offensive Glass: Capitalize on Villanova's weaker defensive rebounding by emphasizing offensive rebounding, particularly with Justin Doellman and Josh Duncan.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Control the Pace: Drew Lavender's ability to control the tempo and facilitate the offense will be key. Utilizing his playmaking skills to create opportunities for teammates and exploit mismatches will be crucial.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Attack the Paint: While Villanova boasts shot-blocking threats, attacking the paint and drawing fouls will be essential. Derrick Brown's effectiveness near the basket can be utilized to challenge their interior defense.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Key Matchups:\n",
    ">Justin Doellman vs. Curtis Sumpter: Limiting Sumpter's scoring and rebounding will be crucial for Doellman.\n",
    "Drew Lavender vs. Mike Nardi: Lavender's ability to control the pace and limit Nardi's playmaking will be critical.\n",
    "Josh Duncan vs. Shane Clark: Duncan's defensive effort on Clark will be crucial in limiting his three-point shooting.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Conclusion:\n",
    "Villanova presents a formidable challenge with their efficient shooting and offensive rebounding. However, by exploiting their weaknesses, particularly their turnovers and defensive rebounding, and utilizing Xavier's strengths in ball pressure, offensive rebounding, and controlled pace, Xavier has a strong chance of securing a victory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thoughts**\n",
    "I was able to find the actual scouting report that Xavier created for their matchup against Villanova back in 2009.\n",
    "Overall, the model correctly identified the key players and strengths of the Villanova team. However in the strategy, it didn’t use these strengths in the strategy. For example it talks about Villanova’s rebounding but doesn’t say to box out, instead it says to crash the glass. These are similar ideas since they both involve rebounding but aren’t exactly the same. However, the LLM is able to hit the nail on the head, and says to focus on Perimeter Defense. This is also included in the real scouting report. In addition, the LLM mentions controling the pace of the game. The real scouting report mentions pace as well in their “Keys to Victory” section. \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "### In General:\n",
    "At the moment LLMs in general, struggle to understand sports and although LLMs can currently answer fact-based questions. When dealing with more rule-based, scenario, or expert level questions that involve a true knowledge of sports, these LLMs really struggle <cite id=\"hj7ur\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FA7PNLSS5\">(Xia et al., 2024)</a></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is mainly because sports is not natural language. There are many terms and nuances when discussing sports, that someone needs to understand in order to really talk about it and understand what they are talking about. Due to the nature of LLMs as \"next-word predictors,\" it seems confident and able to talk about sports <cite id=\"jfsfh\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FF8Z32QVX\">(<i>2. Introduction to Large Language Models for Text Generation</i>, n.d.)</a></cite>. But in reality, LLMs at the moment struggle to really understand sports. \n",
    "\n",
    "Often, even with fact-based questions, LLMs can hallucinate and provide false answers. This output can be dangerous for someone who doesn't know enough about the sport they are prompting about to know that the output is false. This is due to a mix of factors. The main ones being that in general, AI hallucinates and the other being that most LLMs such as ChatGPT 3.5, are not up to date<cite id=\"9kn5i\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FIWZG4XZB\">(<i>1. The Five Principles of Prompting</i>, n.d.)</a></cite>. Thus, asking the model questions about a basketball game that happened last night, will often yield false answers. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is very important that we understand what LLMs can and can not do at the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Looking to the Future:\n",
    "However, the use of LLMs for Sports Analysts is bright. Research projects such as SportQA and SportsSett provide have really exicting implications for the future use of LLMs in Sports Analytics. In addition, my interactions with the Gemini 1.5 Pro model has shown me the power of current the current LLMs out there. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was very impressed by its skills in video analysis, player analysis, and creating reports. In the future, I hope to examine other tasks using the Gemini 1.5 Pro model such as creating data visualizations, creating data metrics for player behavior, and analyzing play-by-plays. Through these future experiments I hope to see if LLMs really understand sports or if it's just generating text based on articles it's been trained on.\n",
