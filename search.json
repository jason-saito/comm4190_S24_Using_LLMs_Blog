    "text": "how LLMs respond to specific prompts whether they are are able or unable to mirror certain human communicative behaviors (e.g.¬†recognize and use idioms) demonstrate the use of an LLM for a specific task (e.g.¬†generating product names, descriptions and branding)\n\nOverview\n\nI tasked ChatGPT with creating product ideas, names, and logos for a product that aims to wake people up by shaking their bed over the traditional approach of using sound to wake someone up.\n\nHow LLMs Respond to Specific Prompts:\n\nI first asked ChatGPT ‚ÄúCan I have a list of product names for an alarm clock that shakes your bed to wake you up?‚Äù. It responded with a list of product names, even linking me to some existing products with links to them.\n\nChat GPT‚Äôs List of Products\n\nHere‚Äôs a list of product names for alarm clocks that are designed to shake your bed to wake you up:\n\nSonic Alert Sonic Bomb Alarm Clock - A solid choice for those hard of hearing, featuring loud alarm sounds and bed shaking functionality„Äê3:3‚Ä†source„Äë.\nAlarm Clock Pro with Bed Shaker by Bellman & Symfon - Offers ascending loud sounds, bright flashing lights, and powerful vibrations, with easily adjustable alarm and time settings„Äê3:4‚Ä†source„Äë.\nSonic Alert Dual Extra Loud Alarm Clock with Bed Shaker (Sonic Boom SBD375SSG) - Known for its large display and extra loud adjustable alarm, alongside the powerful bed shaker feature„Äê3:5‚Ä†source„Äë.\nVibio Bed Shaker by Bellman & Symfon - A wireless bed shaker that connects to your mobile via Bluetooth, allowing for custom vibration power settings and notifications from calls or messages„Äê3:6‚Ä†source„Äë.\niLuv SmartShaker 3 - Offers adjustable vibration strength between five distinct levels, catering to various types of sleepers, whether light or heavy„Äê3:8‚Ä†source„Äë.\nVibio Portable Bluetooth Bed Shaker Alarm - A travel alarm that provides tactile and visual LED alerts for incoming calls and text messages, with adjustable vibrations strength„Äê3:10‚Ä†source„Äë.\nVibroSaver Extremely Strong Vibration Bed Shaker Smart Wi-Fi Alarm Clock - Features multiple alarm and vibration settings, immediate remote vibration, and voice control„Äê3:16‚Ä†source„Äë.\n\nThese products are designed to assist heavy sleepers, the deaf, and the hearing-impaired in waking up more effectively through vibration and, in some cases, loud sound alarms.‚Äù\nI then asked it to create a list of product names for me by asking ‚ÄúI want to make my own product, make me a unique list of product names for an alarm clock that shakes your bed to wake you up.‚Äù\n\nChat GPT‚Äùs List of Product Names\n\nCreating a unique and catchy product name for an alarm clock that shakes your bed to wake you up can set the tone for its brand identity. Here‚Äôs a list of innovative and memorable names for your product:\n\nQuakeWake Alarm\nRumbleRiser Clock\nVibroMorn Alert\nShakeUp Call\nTremorTime Alarm\nWakeQuiver Clock\nMornShake Alert\nVibrAlarm Wake\nShakeRouse Clock\nBedShocker Alert\nBuzzShake Morning\nRiseVibe Alarm\nShakeBolt Wakeup\nVibrateAwake Clock\nPulseWake System\n\nThese names aim to encapsulate the essence of the product‚Äîits ability to shake and wake users from their sleep in a unique way. Each name combines elements of vibration, waking, and morning, suggesting the product‚Äôs primary function and appeal.\nInspired by the list of names, I decided to go with the name ‚ÄúShake ‚ÄôN Wake.‚Äù After coming up with a name, I asked ChatGPT to make me a logo with the company name ‚ÄúShake ‚ÄôN Wake.‚Äù\n\nChat GPT‚Äôs Logo + Response\n\n\nHere‚Äôs the logo for ‚ÄúShake ‚ÄôN Wake‚Äù. It‚Äôs designed to reflect the energy, wakefulness, and innovative aspect of your alarm clocks that shake the bed to wake up users. The colors and elements chosen aim to evoke the sense of morning energy and the unique functionality of your product.\nI then asked ChatGPT to make it more modern and simplistic.\n\nChat GPT‚Äôs Second Logo\n\n\n\nCan they mirror certain human communicative behaviors?\n\nOverall, I was pleased with how ChatGPT responded to my prompts. I was really suprised at first when it replied to me with a list of real, pre-existing products rather than giving me a list of fake product names. With that regard, I felt like it misunderstood what I was prompting it to do, however, after re-prompting it I was able to get a response I liked better. I‚Äôm curious why the seconed logo has 4 different variations from one output rather than one logo, like the original output."
