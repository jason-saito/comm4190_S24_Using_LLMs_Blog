    "text": "After reading Chapter 3 of insert title, I wanted to test how well the “explain like you’re talking to a 5-year old prompt really worked.\nI prompted ChatGPT 4 with the prompt, “explain Artificial Intelligence and LLMs to me as if I was 5. provide it to me in the format of a text and images that I can use to make a children’s picture book.” I then combined the text with the images it provided from DALL-E below as a PDF.\n\nClick the preview above to view the full PDF.\n\nHow LLMs Respond to Various Prompts\n\nOverall, I’m pretty happy with how the book came out, I used ChatGPT4 to get the outputs above and was provided with both the suggested text as well as the image descriptions.\n\nInput:\n\nExplain Artificial Intelligence and LLMs to me as if I was 5. provide it to me in the format of a text and images that I can use to make a children’s picture book\n\nResponse:\n\nSure, let’s break down Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) into simple concepts that could be explained to a 5-year-old, complete with a storyline for a children’s picture book. Here we go:\nText for the Children’s Picture Book Title: The Magical World of AI and the Wise Owls\nPage 1: In a faraway land filled with wonder and magic, there lived smart creatures known as the Wise Owls. These owls were very special because they could understand and speak any language!\nImage: A colorful forest with various animals, and in the center, an owl wearing glasses and surrounded by books.\nPage 2: The Wise Owls were part of something much bigger, a magical world called Artificial Intelligence, or AI for short. AI is like a fairy tale come to life, where machines can learn and do things just like humans.\nImage: A majestic tree with branches representing different magical abilities, like speaking, seeing, and solving puzzles. An owl is perched on each branch.\nPage 3: One of the most magical spells in this world was called LLM, which stands for Large Language Model. These spells allowed the Wise Owls to listen carefully and give the best answers they could.\nImage: A group of owls sitting around a crystal ball, filled with swirling letters and words, casting a spell together.\nPage 4: Imagine you asked, “Why is the sky blue?” A Wise Owl would whisper to the wind, gather the words from their magical spell, and tell you a story about the sun and the earth that makes the sky look blue.\nImage: A curious child asking an owl a question, with the owl responding. The background shows a whimsical interpretation of the sky and sun.\nPage 5: The Wise Owls learned from the biggest library ever, with books about everything from ants to galaxies. But instead of turning pages, they would magically absorb all the knowledge.\nImage: An enormous, enchanting library with books flying into the minds of the owls.\nPage 6: Sometimes, even Wise Owls need to learn more. If they don’t know something, they say, “Let’s discover it together!” because learning is an adventure that never ends.\nImage: An owl and a child holding hands, walking towards a treasure chest that glows with new knowledge.\nPage 7: The Wise Owls always remind us that the magic of AI is very powerful. It can create wonderful things, solve tricky problems, and make the world a better place if used with kindness and care.\nImage: Different animals using gadgets and screens, showing happy faces as owls help them understand and solve problems.\nPage 8: And so, in the magical world of AI and the Wise Owls, every day is a chance to learn something new, to help others, and to imagine the endless possibilities that tomorrow can bring.\nImage: A vibrant sunset over the magical forest, with all the animals and owls looking up at the sky, dreaming about the future.\nNow, let’s create an image based on the first page to start this magical journey.\nLet’s generate an image for Page 1:\nA colorful forest with various animals, and in the center, an owl wearing glasses and surrounded by books. This owl looks wise and welcoming, inviting everyone into the magical world of AI. The forest is vibrant with greens, blues, and a variety of animals peeking from behind the trees, intrigued by the owl’s knowledge.\nA colorful forest with various animals, and in the center, an owl wearing glasses and surrounded by books. This owl looks wise and welcoming, inviting everyone into the magical world of AI. The forest is vibrant with greens, blues, and a variety of animals peeking from behind the trees, intrigued by the owl’s knowledge. Here’s the first page of our magical journey into the world of AI and the Wise Owls. This image sets the scene for our children’s picture book, introducing the magical forest where our story begins. You can use this image to help illustrate the story and capture the imagination of young readers.\nIf you’d like to continue with illustrations for the rest of the pages or need further adjustments, feel free to let me know!\n\nComments\n\nOverall, I’m happy with the text output and am impressed with the structure of the output, especially since it provided me everything I wanted with page text and image description, then outputting the images. However, I noticed that the output is not perfect. For example, the images do not maintain the same art style and fail to correctly replicate human writing/text in the images. In the future, I’d like to explore if ChatGPT can use consistent art styles and correct texts in its images."

    "text": "Introduction\n\nI decided to re-explore a concept brought upon in my Second Blog Post, where I tested if AI could solve riddles. This blog post will explore how AI interacts with images.\n\nReturning to the Riddles\n\nI began by providing the llava-v1.6-24b model the same image from my initial post, prompting it to state the number of matches in the image.\n\nWhile the correct answer is 15 matches, the model said that “There are 12 matches in the image.”\nI attempted to correct it by saying, “note that matches in this image are of varying sizes, some are smaller than others, but are still considered matches.” However, it still believed its answer was correct, it said “Thank you for the clarification. In that case, there are 12 matches in total, including the varying sizes.”\nI then attempted to correct it and prompted it with “this is incorrect, please recalculate and provide reasoning for your answer.” However, its response was “I apologize for the mistake. Let’s recalculate the number of matches in the image.\nThere are 12 matches in total, including the varying sizes. The image shows a total of 12 matches, with some being smaller than others.”\nIn this case, the model failed to recognize the correct number of matches in the image.\n\nInterpreting Data Visualizations\n\nI was curious to see how the model interpreted data and provided it a sample pie chart I found from google.\n\nI prompted it with the goal of giving it context about the type of graph and exactly what I wanted to learn about the data. I prompted it with “based on the image provided, interpret the data and describe how water usage is broken down in the pie chart.” I was shocked by its response:\n“The pie chart in the image illustrates the breakdown of water usage in a residential setting. It is divided into six categories, each representing a different source of water consumption. Here’s the breakdown as shown in the chart:\nShower - 16.8% This category represents the water used for showering, which is the second-largest contributor to residential water usage.\nToilet - 26.7% The toilet is the largest single source of water usage in a residential setting, accounting for nearly a quarter of the total.\nFaucet - 15.7% Water used at the faucet, likely for activities such as washing hands and brushing teeth, is the third-largest category.\nClothes Washer - 21.7% The water used for washing clothes in a clothes washer is the fourth-largest category.\nLeaks - 13.7% Water leaks, which can occur in various parts of a home, such as faucets, pipes, or appliances, account for 13.7% of residential water usage.\nOther - 5.3% This category includes all other sources of water usage that do not fit into the other five categories. It is the smallest category on the chart.\nThe chart is sourced from the American Water Works Association Research Foundation, and it is based on data from 1999. It provides a visual representation of where most of the water used in a residential home goes, highlighting the importance of water conservation efforts in areas such as toilet and faucet usage.”\nShockingly, it was able to successfully describe the pie chart, the exact breakdown of the chart, as well as where the image was from. This was a stark contrast from the previous experiment I ran with the matches puzzle.\n\nConclusion\n\nI was overall pleased with the results and felt like the model did a solid job of recognizing the image and interpreting the data. However, I noticed that it struggled to recognize the “matches” when they were different sizes in the first image. In the future, I hope to explore how the model reacts to different types of charts and data."

    "text": "Introduction\n\nOver the weekend, I attended my first Hackathon! It just so happens, it was related to Generative-AI. Being a fully-rookie team, my group quickly found used our interests in the intersections of Data Analytics and Basketball to create a project. The goal was to use LLMs to generate scouting reports for basketball teams to gain better insights and improve their stradegies. You can find our repository here.\n\nData Visualizations\n\nOur first goal was to provide Data Visualizations to provide coaches with a clear way to examine their team’s strengths and weaknesses. We stumbled upon the Spider Chart through a Tik Tok video that we felt clearly showed patterns in playstyle like we hoped for, and decided to use it in our scouting reports.\nAfter deciding our approach, we found a NBA dataset on Kaggle to use for our data visualizations. We used plotly to provide interactive graphs that allowed users to compare players and teams from either a single year, range of years, or all years.\nHere is an example player comparison, comparing players from two different eras.\n\nOr teams from two different eras.\n\nAnd current teams.\n\n\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\n\nIn order to provide the scouting reports, we used RAG. A blog post will follow about how we used RAG, but, overall, we fed the model exampels of NBA scouting reports, NBA articles, and player data in order for it to present the most accuate findings in a scouting report structure.\nOverall, we were pleased with the results, however noticed inconsitencies in the responses where the model often referenced players that were no longer on the team, despite prompting it to analyze a team from a specific year. I believe this could be due to the use of older articles in either its training data or the articles we were providing it. In the future, I’d like to look into feeding the model data in the form of CSVs and providing it articles from ESPN written in only this year.\nHere is an example scouting report output: \n\nThe Interface\n\nAs shown below, the user inputs either teams or players they would like to compare and specify the years they would like to analyze.\n  \n\nConclusion\n\nI had a great time at my first hackathon and exploring the world of Generative AI through sports. In the future, I’d like to further explore Langchain as well as RAG. I’d also like to tweak my data and provide current articles and csvs of data to provide more accurate scouting reports. I’d also like to see if models like LLava can provide insights given the spiderplots."

    "text": "Overview\n\nI tasked ChatGPT with creating product ideas, names, and logos for a product that aims to wake people up by shaking their bed over the traditional approach of using sound to wake someone up.\n\nHow LLMs Respond to Specific Prompts:\n\nI first asked ChatGPT “Can I have a list of product names for an alarm clock that shakes your bed to wake you up?”. It responded with a list of product names, even linking me to some existing products with links to them.\n\nChat GPT’s List of Products\n\nHere’s a list of product names for alarm clocks that are designed to shake your bed to wake you up:\n\nSonic Alert Sonic Bomb Alarm Clock - A solid choice for those hard of hearing, featuring loud alarm sounds and bed shaking functionality【3:3†source】.\nAlarm Clock Pro with Bed Shaker by Bellman & Symfon - Offers ascending loud sounds, bright flashing lights, and powerful vibrations, with easily adjustable alarm and time settings【3:4†source】.\nSonic Alert Dual Extra Loud Alarm Clock with Bed Shaker (Sonic Boom SBD375SSG) - Known for its large display and extra loud adjustable alarm, alongside the powerful bed shaker feature【3:5†source】.\nVibio Bed Shaker by Bellman & Symfon - A wireless bed shaker that connects to your mobile via Bluetooth, allowing for custom vibration power settings and notifications from calls or messages【3:6†source】.\niLuv SmartShaker 3 - Offers adjustable vibration strength between five distinct levels, catering to various types of sleepers, whether light or heavy【3:8†source】.\nVibio Portable Bluetooth Bed Shaker Alarm - A travel alarm that provides tactile and visual LED alerts for incoming calls and text messages, with adjustable vibrations strength【3:10†source】.\nVibroSaver Extremely Strong Vibration Bed Shaker Smart Wi-Fi Alarm Clock - Features multiple alarm and vibration settings, immediate remote vibration, and voice control【3:16†source】.\n\nThese products are designed to assist heavy sleepers, the deaf, and the hearing-impaired in waking up more effectively through vibration and, in some cases, loud sound alarms.”\nI then asked it to create a list of product names for me by asking “I want to make my own product, make me a unique list of product names for an alarm clock that shakes your bed to wake you up.”\n\nChat GPT”s List of Product Names\n\nCreating a unique and catchy product name for an alarm clock that shakes your bed to wake you up can set the tone for its brand identity. Here’s a list of innovative and memorable names for your product:\n\nQuakeWake Alarm\nRumbleRiser Clock\nVibroMorn Alert\nShakeUp Call\nTremorTime Alarm\nWakeQuiver Clock\nMornShake Alert\nVibrAlarm Wake\nShakeRouse Clock\nBedShocker Alert\nBuzzShake Morning\nRiseVibe Alarm\nShakeBolt Wakeup\nVibrateAwake Clock\nPulseWake System\n\nThese names aim to encapsulate the essence of the product—its ability to shake and wake users from their sleep in a unique way. Each name combines elements of vibration, waking, and morning, suggesting the product’s primary function and appeal.\nInspired by the list of names, I decided to go with the name “Shake ’N Wake.” After coming up with a name, I asked ChatGPT to make me a logo with the company name “Shake ’N Wake.”\n\nChat GPT’s Logo + Response\n\n\nHere’s the logo for “Shake ’N Wake”. It’s designed to reflect the energy, wakefulness, and innovative aspect of your alarm clocks that shake the bed to wake up users. The colors and elements chosen aim to evoke the sense of morning energy and the unique functionality of your product.\nI then asked ChatGPT to make it more modern and simplistic.\n\nChat GPT’s Second Logo\n\n\n\nCan they mirror certain human communicative behaviors?\n\nOverall, I was pleased with how ChatGPT responded to my prompts. I was really suprised at first when it replied to me with a list of real, pre-existing products rather than giving me a list of fake product names. With that regard, I felt like it misunderstood what I was prompting it to do, however, after re-prompting it I was able to get a response I liked better. I’m curious why the seconed logo has 4 different variations from one output rather than one logo, like the original output."

    "text": "Overview\n\nI was curious to see how well ChatGPT and LLama could identify matches in a photo as well logically think through match riddles. This was mainly inspired by a youtube video I watched for class, where many of the leaders of AI questioned whether or not AI can think for itself or if it’s simply a word predictor. I was really curious by this and decided to give it some match riddles that I found on the internet. They were pretty straightforward and I thought it could be a good test to see if ChatGPT and LLama can really think for themselves.\n\nHow LLMs Respond to Various Prompts\n\nBelow is the image riddle that I presented ChatGPT with.\n\nMy approach was giving ChatGPT and LLama more and more context to the riddle to see if there was a certain point where it could answer the riddle correctly. My initial prompt was “Given matches in the shapes of 1+11+111=111 in roman numerals. Correct the equation by moving 1 matchstick.”\n\nChat GPT’s Initial Response\n\nIn Roman numerals, the equation 1+11+111=111 can be rewritten as:\nI + XI + CXI = CXI\nTo correct the equation by moving only one matchstick, we can take one matchstick from the “XI” (which is 11 in Roman numerals) and use it to turn the “I” (which is 1) into a “V” (which is 5 in Roman numerals). This will change the equation to:\nV + I + CXI = CXI\nIn Roman numerals, this equation translates to:\n5 + 1 + 111 = 111\nThis does not make a correct equation as 5 + 1 + 111 is equal to 117, not 111. Instead, we can move a matchstick to make a correct equation. Here’s how:\nTake one matchstick from the first “XI” (11 in Roman numerals) and place it on the “+” sign to create an “X” (10 in Roman numerals). This will change the equation to:\nI + X + I + CXI = CXI\nNow, we have the equation:\n1 + 10 + 1 + 111 = 111\nWhich simplifies to:\n123 = 111\nThis is still incorrect, so let’s try another approach. If we move one matchstick from the “+” sign between the “11” and “111” and place it on the “=” sign to form a “≠” sign (which stands for “not equal to”), we get:\nI + XI + CXI ≠ CXI\nNow, the equation reads:\n1 + 11 + 111 ≠ 111\nThis statement is true, as 123 is indeed not equal to 111. But this creates a true inequality rather than a true equation. If we want an equation that balances, we need to form different numbers.\nAnother solution is to move a matchstick from the “plus” sign and turn the “I” from the “111” on the right side of the equation into a “V”. The equation would be:\nI + XI + CXI = CVI\nNow, we have the equation:\n1 + 11 + 111 = 106\nWhich is a correct equation because 1 + 11 + 111 equals 123, and in Roman numerals, 123 is written as “CXXIII,” not “CVI.” It seems the puzzle as given is unsolvable by moving only one matchstick to create a valid equation in Roman numerals.\nIf it is indeed a requirement to correct the equation into a valid one by moving only one matchstick, and the equation must remain an equation (not an inequality), then I must admit that I am unable to provide a solution that fits these constraints using standard Roman numerals. It’s possible that there’s a creative interpretation or a particular arrangement of the matchsticks that I haven’t considered. If you could provide more context or additional rules, I may be able to assist further.\n\nLLama’s Initial Response\n\nThe equation in Roman numerals is:\nI + X + CXI = CXI\nTo correct the equation by moving one matchstick, we can move the X from the left-hand side to the right-hand side, like this:\nI + CXI + X = CXI\nThis equation is now balanced, with the Roman numerals adding up to 111 on both sides.\nUnfortunately, both answers were wrong, so I decided to give them both more context. I reprompted it with “This is incorrect. Here is a visual representation of the riddle I am providing: https://www.mindyourlogic.com/static/matchstick/Roman_number_1+11+111=111_Matchstick_puzzle.webp,” and got the following answers.\n\nChatGPT’s Respone\n\nThank you for providing the visual representation of the matchstick puzzle. The image shows the equation “I + XI + III = III” in Roman numerals, where “I” represents 1, “XI” represents 11, and “III” represents 3.\nTo correct the equation by moving only one matchstick, we can change the “XI” (which is 11 in Roman numerals) into “IX” (which is 9 in Roman numerals). Here’s what you do:\nMove the matchstick that forms the bottom part of the “X” in “XI” and place it at the end of the “I” on the left side. This changes “XI” to “IX” and the equation now reads:\nI + IX + III = III\nThe Roman numerals now represent:\n1 + 9 + 3 = 13\nIn Roman numerals, thirteen is written as “XIII,” which matches the “III” on the right side of the equation when the “X” from the “IX” we created is added to it.\nSo the corrected equation is:\nI + IX + III = XIII\nWhich is a valid equation, as 1 + 9 + 3 indeed equals 13.\n\nLlama’s Response\n\nMy apologies for the mistake. Thank you for providing a visual representation of the riddle. Here’s the corrected solution:\nTo balance the equation, we can move the X from the left-hand side to the right-hand side, like this:\nI + 11 + 111 = 111\nNow, we can simplify the equation by combining the like terms:\nI + 11 + 111 = 111\n1 + 11 + 111 = 111\n1 + 111 + 111 = 111\n1 + 222 = 111\n222 = 111\nTherefore, the solution to the riddle is:\n222 = 111\nI hope this clears up any confusion, and please let me know if you have any further questions!\nAfter seeing incorrect responses again, I decided to provide both LLMs with more context and even provided them new approaches. I prompted it with “This is incorrect. Remember that each match can be oriented to be vertical or horizontal, also, the equal signs can be altered as well as they are made of matches.”\n\nLLama’s Response\n\nAh, I apologize for my mistake. Here’s another attempt at solving the riddle, taking into account the additional constraints you’ve mentioned:\nI + 11 + 111 = 111\nWe can start by rotating the first matchstick (I) 90 degrees clockwise, so that it becomes vertical. This gives us:\n1 | + 11 + 111 = 111\nNext, we can rotate the second matchstick (11) 90 degrees counterclockwise, so that it becomes horizontal. This gives us:\n1 | + 11 | 111 = 111\nFinally, we can rotate the third matchstick (111) 90 degrees clockwise, so that it becomes vertical. This gives us:\n1 | + 11 | 111 = 111\nNow, we can simplify the equation by combining the like terms:\n1 | + 11 | 111 = 111\n1 + 11 + 111 = 111\n1 + 122 = 111\n122 = 111\nTherefore, the solution to the riddle is:\n122 = 111\nI hope this solution is correct. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\nI apologize for the misunderstanding. Given the new information and the ability to alter the equals sign, the solution to the matchstick puzzle is as follows:\nThe original equation represented by matchsticks is “I + XI + III = III,” which translates to “1 + 11 + 3 = 3” in Arabic numerals. This is incorrect.\nTo correct the equation by moving only one matchstick, you can take the vertical matchstick from the plus sign on the right (which is the middle matchstick of the three that make up the plus sign) and move it to the last “I” of the “III” on the right side of the equals sign. This would turn the “III” into a “V,” which represents the number 5 in Roman numerals.\nNow the equation reads:\nI + XI + II = V\nIn Arabic numerals, this is “1 + 11 + 2 = 5,” which is a correct equation.\nEventually I realized that it might not be possible for ChatGPT and LLama to solve the riddle, so I was wondering if they could atleast explain how the riddle works. I prompted it with “This is the correct answer: https://www.mindyourlogic.com/static/matchstick/Answer_Roman_number_1+11+111=111_Matchstick_puzzle.webp. Explain why it is correct”\nHowever, neither could correctly explain the riddle.\n\nLLama’s Response\n\nThe solution to the matchstick puzzle is correct because it satisfies the equation 1+11+111=111, which is a true mathematical statement.\nHere’s how the equation is represented in the solution:\n1 = I (the first matchstick) 11 = XI (the second matchstick, rotated 90 degrees clockwise) 111 = CXI (the third matchstick, rotated 90 degrees clockwise)\nThe equation 1+11+111=111 is a simple arithmetic equation, and it is true because:\n1 + 11 = 12 12 + 111 = 123\nTherefore, the solution to the matchstick puzzle is correct because it accurately represents the equation 1+11+111=111 using matchsticks. The puzzle requires us to think creatively and use the matchsticks to represent the numbers in a way that satisfies the equation, and the solution does just that.\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\nThank you for providing the solution image. The correct answer to the puzzle shows the matchstick equation altered to form the following:\nIX + I + I = III\nIn Roman numerals, “IX” represents the number 9, “I” represents the number 1, and “III” represents the number 3.\nThe matchstick that was moved was taken from the “plus” sign and used to turn the “XI” (which is 11) into “IX” (which is 9). This change was accomplished by moving the horizontal matchstick from the plus sign to the left side of the “X” to create the “IX.”\nNow, let’s break down the corrected equation:\n\n“IX” is 9.\nThe first “I” is 1.\nThe second “I” is also 1.\n\nAdding these together:\n9 (IX) + 1 (I) + 1 (I) = 11 (XI)\nHowever, in the image provided, the equation now appears as “IX + I + I = III,” which seems to imply that 9 + 1 + 1 = 3. This doesn’t add up correctly in standard arithmetic because the sum of 9 + 1 + 1 is actually 11, not 3.\nThe confusion arises from the representation of the solution. The correct reading should be “IX + I + I = XI,” where the last “I” in “III” is interpreted as part of the equals sign. This is a common style in matchstick puzzles where a matchstick can be used to creatively form different symbols or numbers.\nThus, the correct interpretation of the altered equation with the moved matchstick is:\n9 (IX) + 1 (I) + 1 (I) = 11 (XI)\nThis is a valid equation and is why the provided solution is correct.\n\nCan they mirror certain human communicative behaviors?\n\nI was really suprised that both ChatGPT and LLama struggled with the riddle as a whole. I feel like an issue could be that neither LLM can identify the matches in the image. I asked both the LLMs how many matches were in the initial images and they both incorrectly counted the number of matches. In terms of their approaches to the were alright, but I feel like since neither accurately solved the riddles, they failed to mirror human communicative behaviors."
