    "text": "After reading Chapter 3 of insert title, I wanted to test how well the “explain like you’re talking to a 5-year old prompt really worked.\nI prompted ChatGPT 4 with the prompt, “explain Artificial Intelligence and LLMs to me as if I was 5. provide it to me in the format of a text and images that I can use to make a children’s picture book.” I then combined the text with the images it provided from DALL-E below as a PDF.\n\nClick the preview above to view the full PDF.\n\nHow LLMs Respond to Various Prompts\n\nOverall, I’m pretty happy with how the book came out, I used ChatGPT4 to get the outputs above and was provided with both the suggested text as well as the image descriptions.\n\nInput:\n\nExplain Artificial Intelligence and LLMs to me as if I was 5. provide it to me in the format of a text and images that I can use to make a children’s picture book\n\nResponse:\n\nSure, let’s break down Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) into simple concepts that could be explained to a 5-year-old, complete with a storyline for a children’s picture book. Here we go:\nText for the Children’s Picture Book Title: The Magical World of AI and the Wise Owls\nPage 1: In a faraway land filled with wonder and magic, there lived smart creatures known as the Wise Owls. These owls were very special because they could understand and speak any language!\nImage: A colorful forest with various animals, and in the center, an owl wearing glasses and surrounded by books.\nPage 2: The Wise Owls were part of something much bigger, a magical world called Artificial Intelligence, or AI for short. AI is like a fairy tale come to life, where machines can learn and do things just like humans.\nImage: A majestic tree with branches representing different magical abilities, like speaking, seeing, and solving puzzles. An owl is perched on each branch.\nPage 3: One of the most magical spells in this world was called LLM, which stands for Large Language Model. These spells allowed the Wise Owls to listen carefully and give the best answers they could.\nImage: A group of owls sitting around a crystal ball, filled with swirling letters and words, casting a spell together.\nPage 4: Imagine you asked, “Why is the sky blue?” A Wise Owl would whisper to the wind, gather the words from their magical spell, and tell you a story about the sun and the earth that makes the sky look blue.\nImage: A curious child asking an owl a question, with the owl responding. The background shows a whimsical interpretation of the sky and sun.\nPage 5: The Wise Owls learned from the biggest library ever, with books about everything from ants to galaxies. But instead of turning pages, they would magically absorb all the knowledge.\nImage: An enormous, enchanting library with books flying into the minds of the owls.\nPage 6: Sometimes, even Wise Owls need to learn more. If they don’t know something, they say, “Let’s discover it together!” because learning is an adventure that never ends.\nImage: An owl and a child holding hands, walking towards a treasure chest that glows with new knowledge.\nPage 7: The Wise Owls always remind us that the magic of AI is very powerful. It can create wonderful things, solve tricky problems, and make the world a better place if used with kindness and care.\nImage: Different animals using gadgets and screens, showing happy faces as owls help them understand and solve problems.\nPage 8: And so, in the magical world of AI and the Wise Owls, every day is a chance to learn something new, to help others, and to imagine the endless possibilities that tomorrow can bring.\nImage: A vibrant sunset over the magical forest, with all the animals and owls looking up at the sky, dreaming about the future.\nNow, let’s create an image based on the first page to start this magical journey.\nLet’s generate an image for Page 1:\nA colorful forest with various animals, and in the center, an owl wearing glasses and surrounded by books. This owl looks wise and welcoming, inviting everyone into the magical world of AI. The forest is vibrant with greens, blues, and a variety of animals peeking from behind the trees, intrigued by the owl’s knowledge.\nA colorful forest with various animals, and in the center, an owl wearing glasses and surrounded by books. This owl looks wise and welcoming, inviting everyone into the magical world of AI. The forest is vibrant with greens, blues, and a variety of animals peeking from behind the trees, intrigued by the owl’s knowledge. Here’s the first page of our magical journey into the world of AI and the Wise Owls. This image sets the scene for our children’s picture book, introducing the magical forest where our story begins. You can use this image to help illustrate the story and capture the imagination of young readers.\nIf you’d like to continue with illustrations for the rest of the pages or need further adjustments, feel free to let me know!\n\nComments\n\nOverall, I’m happy with the text output and am impressed with the structure of the output, especially since it provided me everything I wanted with page text and image description, then outputting the images. However, I noticed that the output is not perfect. For example, the images do not maintain the same art style and fail to correctly replicate human writing/text in the images. In the future, I’d like to explore if ChatGPT can use consistent art styles and correct texts in its images."

    "title": "LLMs and Basketball Highlight Analysis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nI was stumbling across YouTube when researching for my final project about the intersections of Sports Analytics and LLMs. I curious to see if there were any Generative AI tools out there that analyzed videos such as sports highlights, game summarys, etc. It turns out there was one tool called  “Pegasus” by Twelve Labs. \nI decided to check it out further on their  website  and was fascinated about their use of video to text and how it makes its outputs. I decided to test it out myself and made an account.\nImmediately I was pleased to see the tool’s connection to sports, with its “stronger domain knowledge” for sports as well as its main features.  \n\n\nTesting the Model\nI wanted to see how well the model really understood sports and decided to provide it one of the most iconic moments in basketball history. Thankfully, the video includes the moment from multiple angles and lots of dialogue, that the model could hopefully pick up on and provide an analysis of.\n\n\n\nRay Allen’s Clutch Three\n\n\nAfter providing the YouTube link, it took a few minutes to process it.\n\n\nPrompting\nOnce loaded, I prompted the model with the question, “Explain what’s happening in the video. For context, you’re watching a basketball game highlight. Explain the key words in basketball such as”rebound,” “3 pointer,” etc.\n\n\nResponse #1\nLeBron’s Layup Tie: Miami Heat vs. San Antonio Spurs’ Intense Fourth Quarter with Ray Allen’s Game-Tying Three-Pointer\nTopic:\nThrilling Basketball Playoffs Moment: LeBron James’ Game-Tying Layup by Ray Allen’s Historic Three-Point Shot.\nHashtags\n#basketball #MiamiHeat #SanAntonioSpurs #LeBronJames #playoffgame #NBA #excitement\nSummary\nThe video captures an intense moment from a basketball game between the Miami Heat and the San Antonio Spurs. The game is in the fourth quarter with the Heat leading by 3 points and 9 minutes and 11 seconds remaining on the clock. The focus is on the Heat’s LeBron James, number 34, who has the ball. LeBron skillfully maneuvers around a Spurs defender and makes a layup, scoring for the Heat. The crowd erupts in cheers as LeBron completes the basket, and his teammates on the bench join in the celebration. LeBron acknowledges the crowd with a raised fist, expressing triumph. The video showcases the athleticism and skill of the players, as well as the passion and engagement of the fans. Throughout the video, there are references to basketball terms such as rebound, three-pointer, and the history of three-point shooters in the NBA. This basketball game highlight captures the excitement and intensity of the sport.\n\n\nThoughts\nThis output is not correct. The heat were actually down by 3 points with 9 seconds left to go. Ray Allen took a 3 pointer, not lebron taking a layup.\nI re- attempted with the same prompt but with a lower temperature this time (to 0).\n\n\nResponse #2\nBased on the visual information provided, the video is a basketball game highlight between the Miami Heat and the San Antonio Spurs. The footage captures a sequence of plays involving LeBron James (#34) from the Heat team. The game is in the fourth quarter, with the Heat leading by 3 points (89-86) and 9 minutes and 11 seconds remaining on the game clock. In terms of basketball terminology, the video showcases various key words and actions. These include: Rebound: This refers to the act of retrieving the ball after a missed shot. In the video, there are instances where players from both teams attempt to grab rebounds after missed shots. 3 pointer: A 3 pointer is a shot taken from beyond the three-point line, with the potential to score three points. The video captures moments where players attempt and make successful 3-point shots. Foul: A foul is a violation of the rules, often resulting in free throws for the opposing team. While the video does not explicitly show fouls, it is mentioned in the answer that potential fouls occur during the game. The base description provides additional context about the video. It mentions that the footage is taken from a high vantage point, likely from the upper level of the arena. The scoreboard indicates that the game is being broadcasted on ESPN and shows the score, time remaining, and team abbreviations. The description also highlights the excitement of the crowd and the intense atmosphere of a high-stakes playoff game. In summary, the video is a basketball game highlight showcasing LeBron James and featuring moments of rebounding, 3-point shots, and potential fouls. The base description provides further details about the game, the teams involved, and the overall atmosphere.\n\n\nThoughts\nThis response is slightly better, it actually answered my question about basketball terminology as well as provided that the game was on ESPN. However, the score and the play are both not true.\n\n\nPrompting\nI tried it again with a temperature of 0.01.\n\n\nResponse #3\nThe video captures a thrilling moment from a basketball game between the Miami Heat and the San Antonio Spurs. The footage is taken from a high vantage point, providing a clear view of the court and the crowd. The game is in the fourth quarter with the Heat leading by 3 points, 89-86, with 9:11 remaining on the game clock. The focus is on the Heat’s number 34, LeBron James, who is in possession of the basketball. LeBron skillfully maneuvers around a Spurs defender and makes a layup, scoring for the Heat. The crowd erupts in cheers as LeBron completes the basket, and his teammates on the bench join in the celebration. The video showcases the intensity and excitement of professional basketball, highlighting the athleticism and skill of the players, as well as the passion and engagement of the fans.\n\n\nThoughts\nThis response is still inaccurate. However, the “chapters” of the video are accurate. I’m not sure why it’s not able to summarize the video but can categorize the video into different sections.\n\nChapters:\n\nIntense Playoff Game 00:00:00 - 00:00:09 The video captures a thrilling moment from a basketball game between the Miami Heat and the San Antonio Spurs, as indicated by the team abbreviations ‘MIA’ and ‘SAS’ displayed on the scoreboard. The footage is taken from a high vantage point, likely from the upper level of the arena, providing a clear view of the court and the crowd. The scoreboard shows that the game is in the fourth quarter with the Heat leading by 3 points, 89-86, with 9:11 remaining on the game clock. The scoreboard also displays the ‘ESPN’ logo, suggesting that the game is being broadcasted on ESPN.\nLeBron’s Incredible Shot 00:00:10 - 00:00:30 As LeBron approaches the basket, he is met by a Spurs defender who attempts to block his shot. LeBron skillfully maneuvers around the defender and makes a layup, scoring for the Heat. The crowd erupts in cheers as LeBron completes the basket, and his teammates on the bench join in the celebration.\nRay Allen’s Game-Tying Three 00:00:34 - 00:00:48 Ray Allen hit a huge three-pointer to tie the game. He backed up behind the three-point line as he caught the pass and then came right back into the shot. The crowd goes wild as the game is now tied.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nOverall, I think the model is solid. It does a good job summarizing the video through chapters but is not able to tell me key details about the video such as what shot he took, the time left in the game, and who shot the ball. I hope to try the model with other sports to see how it performs."

    "text": "Introduction to AI Music\n\nMy first exposure to the world of AI-Generated music came around a year ago when I watched this video.\nBeing a fan of both Drake and the Weeknd, it was shocking to me how real they sounded in the video. At first, I thought it was a real song but after reading that it was AI generated I was blown away.\n Watch the video here!\n\nExperimenting with AI Music\n\nOne of the first tools I stumbled upon is Suno AI. Immediately you’re greated with examples of AI-generated songs. One of my favorites is titled “Make a song about the moon.”\n\n\n\nSuno AI\n\n\nAfter seeing a preview of the tool, I decieded to make my own song. I used Gemini to make an R&B song. \nI present,\n “Midnight Serenade.”\nI decided to test out Suno AI’s custom feature where you can give it a genre and lyrics and it will generate the music. I asked Gemini to generate song lyrics for a Dark R&B song similar to R&B artists Giveon, Brent Faiyaz, and Bryson Tiller.\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\nHere is “Playing with Fire”\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nIn order to replicate music, the AI is trained on large data sets of pre-existing music. From this data set it analizes the various patterns, tempos, rythms, and lyrics associated with various genres of music.\n\nTraining the Model\n\nTraditionally, when training a model, the model takes the data and makes a numerical vector. In order to allow the model to understand the various aspects that go into creating music, the model is trained with MIDI files that are structured in terms of notes, rhyhtm changes, and beats per minute. This MIDI file can be used to train the model and is considered a “natural language representation.”\nThe Machine Learning algorithms then use the raw audio data for the entire song in the form of “sequential input vectors” that are commonly used in NLP. The model then is able to predict the next token for the song.\n\nLegal Implications of AI Music\n\nWith the rise of AI music, there is also a rise in copyright and licensing issues. As, when someone uses AI to imitate another artist’s music, this can muddy the waters of who owns the music, the creator, the AI, or the artist themself.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, I’m really happy with the result. Even though there are some instances where you can tell that the music is AI-generated, I find it fascinating how accurate and human-like the AI sounds overall. It’s also really impressive to me how the AI can make lyrics on its own based on the genre I tell it. In a future blog post I hope to learn more about how the AI can achieve this and sound like a human while singing.\n\nSources\n\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/how-can-an-ai-model-create-music"

    "section": "",
    "text": "What is Retrieval Augmented Generation:\nRetrieval Augmented Generation can be broken down into 3 different steps. The term Retrieval comes from the idea that the user asks a question, and the chatbot searches and finds the most similar data from the data that you provided it. The Augmentation occurs when the prompt and additional context from the data are used to change the “prompt template.” The generation ultimately occurs when the response is provided back.\n\n\nWhen you should use it:\nThere are three main issues with LLMs in general: : First, there is a lack of domain/internal knowledge that you might have since models are trained on publicly available data. This means that models can’t answer questions about your business or any other more-personalized tasks that you might want to explore.\nSecond, LLMs often hallucinate. Although LLMs can seem very confident in their response, they can provide incorrect answers to your questions.\nThird, the training cut off. In all models, there is a date cut off in data that the model was trained with. This means if you want to ask questions about current information, you won’t get a correct response since the model is unaware of this data.\nHowever, all hope is not lost. As, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become one of the frontrunners to solving all of these issues.\n\n\nTechnical Breakdown\nThe user can ask a question to the model like they normally would. Then the model searches for semantically similar data points. Usually this means breaking various documents into seperate chunks/tokens that can be then embedded into the vector database. Once it finds semantically similar data to the question, it “augments” the response using the similar data that if found. It ultimately feeds this context/similar data into the prompt that is called to the LLM. The LLM then sends a response back to the user that has been “generated” based on the augmentation of the data."

    "text": "Introduction\nI wanted to see how well AI can keep track of sports plays and sports data to conduct analysis. I also wanted to see how well it can make strategies. First I begun by giving the models a play-by-play and asking them what the final score was. This task was pretty simple since it’s named at the bottom of the play-by-play, but in the past, models have gotten in wrong. \n\n\nPrompt #1\nGiven the following ESPN play-by-play of the last two minutes of the Boston Celtics versus the OKC Thunder game, what was the final score of the game, for context Payton Pritchard is on the Boston Celtics and so is Lindy Waters III. 1:50 Bismack Biyombo makes 7-foot hook shot (Aaron Wiggins assists) 98 129 1:36 Payton Pritchard makes 15-foot pullup jump shot 98 131 1:24 Aaron Wiggins lost ball turnover (Luke Kornet steals) 98 131 1:20 Lindy Waters III shooting foul 98 131 1:20 Oshae Brissett makes free throw 1 of 2 98 132 1:20 Oshae Brissett makes free throw 2 of 2 98 133 1:01 Lindy Waters III makes 6-foot driving floating jump shot 100 133 50.1 Payton Pritchard makes driving layup 100 135 31.2 Gordon Hayward misses 22-foot three point jumper 100 135 30.2 Oshae Brissett defensive rebound 100 135 6.0 shot clock turnover 100 135 0.0 End of the 4th Quarter 100 135 0.0 End of Game 100 135\n\n\nMixtral Response\nThe final score of the game was 135-100, with the Boston Celtics winning over the OKC Thunder. Payton Pritchard, a guard for the Celtics, made a 15-foot pull-up jump shot to bring the score to 98-131, and then made a driving layup to bring the score to 100-135. Lindy Waters III, a guard for the Thunder, committed a shooting foul and made a 6-foot driving floating jump shot, scoring 2 points for the Thunder during the last two minutes of the game.\n\n\nGemini Pro Response\nCeltics 135, Thunder 100\n\n\nThoughts\nWhile I prefer the Mixtral model’s response since it was a little more in-depth than the Gemini Pro response, both are correct. I then asked both models to summarize a play-by-play.\n\n\nPrompt #2\nThis is the ESPN play by play of the first quarter of the Celtics Thunder game. summarize it. TIME PLAY OKC BOS 12:00 Chet Holmgren vs. Kristaps Porzingis 0 0 11:39 Jaylen Brown misses 24-foot three point jumper 0 0 11:38 Kristaps Porzingis offensive rebound 0 0 11:35 Luguentz Dort personal foul 0 0 11:21 Kristaps Porzingis makes 11-foot two point shot 0 2 11:05 Chet Holmgren misses 27-foot three point jumper 0 2 11:03 Chet Holmgren offensive rebound 0 2 10:58 Chet Holmgren makes driving layup 2 2 10:40 Derrick White misses 25-foot three point jumper 2 2 10:39 Chet Holmgren defensive rebound 2 2 10:25 Derrick White blocks Chet Holmgren ’s 11-foot driving floating jump shot 2 2 10:23 Kristaps Porzingis defensive rebound 2 2\n\n\nMixtral Response\nThe play-by-play shows the first quarter of the Boston Celtics vs. OKC Thunder game. At the start of the quarter, Chet Holmgren of the Thunder and Kristaps Porzingis of the Celtics faced off. The Celtics scored the first points of the game with a two-point shot by Porzingis, and both teams traded baskets for the rest of the quarter with the Celtics leading 30-23 at the end of the first quarter. Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum were the top scorers for the Celtics, while Chet Holmgren, Josh Giddey, and Jaylin Williams played well for the Thunder. There were several lead changes and turnovers in the quarter, with both teams trying to establish their offense.\n\n\nGemini Pro Response\nThe Celtics and Thunder played a close first quarter, with the Celtics ultimately taking a 30-23 lead. The Celtics started the game strong, with Kristaps Porzingis scoring the first two points of the game. The Thunder quickly tied it up, but the Celtics took a 7-2 lead after a three-pointer from Jaylen Brown. The Thunder fought back, and the game was tied at 14-14 with 6:24 remaining in the quarter. The Celtics then went on a 6-0 run, taking a 20-14 lead. The Thunder cut the lead to 20-19, but the Celtics scored the final four points of the quarter to take a 30-23 lead into the second quarter. Jayson Tatum led the Celtics with 12 points in the first quarter, while Jaylen Brown added 6 points. Kristaps Porzingis and Al Horford each had 4 points, and Derrick White had 3 points. For the Thunder, Josh Giddey led the way with 8 points. Luguentz Dort added 6 points, and Jaylin Williams had 4 points.\n\n\nThoughts\nThese responses are also both correct and very in-depth. I’m not sure how the models both know the correct final score of the first quarter since it was not indicated in the prompt and the data cutoffs are both before the game occured. I intend to further look into this in the future\n\n\nPrompt #3\nGiven the stats of the OKC Thunder and the Boston Celtics (I provided the stats from Espn.com), imagine you are the coach of the boston celtics how would you strategize beating the Thunder?\n\n\nMixtral Response\nGiven the stats, here’s a potential strategy for the Boston Celtics to beat the OKC Thunder:\n\nDefensive Strategy: The Celtics should focus on limiting the offensive production of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Chet Holmgren, who are the top scorers and rebounders for the Thunder. Jayson Tatum and Kristaps Porzingis can take turns guarding Holmgren due to their size, while Derrick White and Jaylen Brown can take on the challenge of guarding Gilgeous-Alexander. The Celtics should also aim to limit the Thunder’s second-chance points by boxing out and securing defensive rebounds.\nOffensive Strategy: The Celtics have a balanced offensive attack with multiple scoring options. They should look to exploit their size advantage in the paint with Porzingis, Al Horford, and Tatum against a relatively smaller OKC team. Additionally, they should look to create open shots for their perimeter players, such as Brown and Tatum, by utilizing screens and ball movement to disrupt the Thunder’s defense.\nTransition Defense: The Thunder are a relatively young and athletic team, so the Celtics should prioritize getting back on defense to prevent fast-break opportunities. They should look to push the pace on offense but also be mindful of not leaving themselves vulnerable to easy baskets in transition.\nBall Movement: The Celtics should emphasize ball movement and player movement on offense to create open shots and force the Thunder’s defense to work harder. This will also help prevent the Thunder from focusing too much attention on any one player, as the Celtics have multiple scoring options.\nAdjustments: As with any game, the Celtics should be prepared to make in-game adjustments based on how the Thunder are defending and attacking. This could include changing up their defensive matchups, altering their offensive sets, or incorporating new plays to keep the Thunder off-balance.\n\nOverall, the Celtics should look to utilize their balanced roster and size advantage to control the game’s tempo and limit the Thunder’s offensive production. By executing their game plan effectively, they can increase their chances of securing a victory.\n\n\nGemini Pro Response\n\nBeating the OKC Thunder: A Celtics Coach’s Strategy\nThe OKC Thunder are a young and talented team centered around their star guard, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. To secure a victory, the Celtics need a game plan that exploits the Thunder’s weaknesses and leverages Boston’s strengths.\nHere’s a potential strategy:\nDefense:\n\nLimit Shai Gilgeous-Alexander: He’s their primary scorer and playmaker. Employing a strategy like Box-and-1 or Triangle-and-2 could disrupt his rhythm and force other players to step up. Jrue Holiday, known for his defensive prowess, should be the primary defender, with help from Derrick White and Marcus Smart.\nControl the Paint: Chet Holmgren is a shot-blocking threat, but the Thunder lack significant size beyond him. The Celtics should attack the rim with Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, drawing fouls and creating scoring opportunities. Al Horford and Robert Williams should be active on the offensive glass.\nPressure the Perimeter: The Thunder have several shooters like Isaiah Joe and Aaron Wiggins, but they are not a high-volume three-point shooting team. The Celtics can afford to pressure the ball handlers and force them into contested mid-range shots or turnovers.\n\nOffense:\n\nExploit Mismatches: The Celtics have a versatile offense with multiple scoring options. Tatum and Brown should attack the weaker defenders, while Horford and Williams can exploit their size advantage in the post.\nMove the Ball: The Thunder are a young team and can be prone to defensive lapses. Quick ball movement and player movement can create open shots and scoring opportunities.\nControl the Pace: The Celtics should aim for a slower pace, limiting the Thunder’s fast-break opportunities and forcing them into a half-court game.\n\nAdditional Considerations:\n\nBench Depth: The Celtics have a deeper bench than the Thunder. Utilizing the bench effectively can keep the starters fresh and maintain offensive pressure throughout the game.\nCoaching Adjustments: Being prepared to adjust the game plan based on the flow of the game is crucial.\n\nKey Matchups:\n\nJrue Holiday vs. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander: Limiting SGA’s impact is crucial for the Celtics’ success.\nJayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown vs. Luguentz Dort: Dort is a strong defender, but Tatum and Brown’s offensive versatility should give them the edge.\nAl Horford/Robert Williams vs. Chet Holmgren: The Celtics big men need to be physical and aggressive against Holmgren, limiting his shot-blocking and rebounding.\n\nBy focusing on these strategies and exploiting the Thunder’s weaknesses, the Celtics can increase their chances of securing a victory.\n\n\n\nThoughts\nI really like the formatting of the Gemini Pro response and how it breaks the analysis down into smaller sections. I did notice that the Gemini Pro response did include a player who was traded off the team a year ago, showing that the model is actually using 2023 data. In addition, I think Mixtral’s response is also very good, they’re both in-depth, accurate, and reasonable approaches.\n\n\nConclusion\nIt’s really interesting that both these models performed well and accurately even though their data cutoffs are in 2023 while the game occured in April of 2024. There are some sentences that indicate that the models could be using 2023 data, I think that the models are performing well since these teams haven’t changed much since the 2022-2023 season. I hope to further use and explore these models in the future."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\n\nI was curious to see how well ChatGPT and LLama could identify matches in a photo as well logically think through match riddles. This was mainly inspired by a youtube video I watched for class, where many of the leaders of AI questioned whether or not AI can think for itself or if it’s simply a word predictor. I was really curious by this and decided to give it some match riddles that I found on the internet. They were pretty straightforward and I thought it could be a good test to see if ChatGPT and LLama can really think for themselves.\n\nHow LLMs Respond to Various Prompts\n\nBelow is the image riddle that I presented ChatGPT with.\n\nMy approach was giving ChatGPT and LLama more and more context to the riddle to see if there was a certain point where it could answer the riddle correctly. My initial prompt was “Given matches in the shapes of 1+11+111=111 in roman numerals. Correct the equation by moving 1 matchstick.”\n\nChat GPT’s Initial Response\n\nIn Roman numerals, the equation 1+11+111=111 can be rewritten as:\nI + XI + CXI = CXI\nTo correct the equation by moving only one matchstick, we can take one matchstick from the “XI” (which is 11 in Roman numerals) and use it to turn the “I” (which is 1) into a “V” (which is 5 in Roman numerals). This will change the equation to:\nV + I + CXI = CXI\nIn Roman numerals, this equation translates to:\n5 + 1 + 111 = 111\nThis does not make a correct equation as 5 + 1 + 111 is equal to 117, not 111. Instead, we can move a matchstick to make a correct equation. Here’s how:\nTake one matchstick from the first “XI” (11 in Roman numerals) and place it on the “+” sign to create an “X” (10 in Roman numerals). This will change the equation to:\nI + X + I + CXI = CXI\nNow, we have the equation:\n1 + 10 + 1 + 111 = 111\nWhich simplifies to:\n123 = 111\nThis is still incorrect, so let’s try another approach. If we move one matchstick from the “+” sign between the “11” and “111” and place it on the “=” sign to form a “≠” sign (which stands for “not equal to”), we get:\nI + XI + CXI ≠ CXI\nNow, the equation reads:\n1 + 11 + 111 ≠ 111\nThis statement is true, as 123 is indeed not equal to 111. But this creates a true inequality rather than a true equation. If we want an equation that balances, we need to form different numbers.\nAnother solution is to move a matchstick from the “plus” sign and turn the “I” from the “111” on the right side of the equation into a “V”. The equation would be:\nI + XI + CXI = CVI\nNow, we have the equation:\n1 + 11 + 111 = 106\nWhich is a correct equation because 1 + 11 + 111 equals 123, and in Roman numerals, 123 is written as “CXXIII,” not “CVI.” It seems the puzzle as given is unsolvable by moving only one matchstick to create a valid equation in Roman numerals.\nIf it is indeed a requirement to correct the equation into a valid one by moving only one matchstick, and the equation must remain an equation (not an inequality), then I must admit that I am unable to provide a solution that fits these constraints using standard Roman numerals. It’s possible that there’s a creative interpretation or a particular arrangement of the matchsticks that I haven’t considered. If you could provide more context or additional rules, I may be able to assist further.\n\nLLama’s Initial Response\n\nThe equation in Roman numerals is:\nI + X + CXI = CXI\nTo correct the equation by moving one matchstick, we can move the X from the left-hand side to the right-hand side, like this:\nI + CXI + X = CXI\nThis equation is now balanced, with the Roman numerals adding up to 111 on both sides.\nUnfortunately, both answers were wrong, so I decided to give them both more context. I reprompted it with “This is incorrect. Here is a visual representation of the riddle I am providing: https://www.mindyourlogic.com/static/matchstick/Roman_number_1+11+111=111_Matchstick_puzzle.webp,” and got the following answers.\n\nChatGPT’s Respone\n\nThank you for providing the visual representation of the matchstick puzzle. The image shows the equation “I + XI + III = III” in Roman numerals, where “I” represents 1, “XI” represents 11, and “III” represents 3.\nTo correct the equation by moving only one matchstick, we can change the “XI” (which is 11 in Roman numerals) into “IX” (which is 9 in Roman numerals). Here’s what you do:\nMove the matchstick that forms the bottom part of the “X” in “XI” and place it at the end of the “I” on the left side. This changes “XI” to “IX” and the equation now reads:\nI + IX + III = III\nThe Roman numerals now represent:\n1 + 9 + 3 = 13\nIn Roman numerals, thirteen is written as “XIII,” which matches the “III” on the right side of the equation when the “X” from the “IX” we created is added to it.\nSo the corrected equation is:\nI + IX + III = XIII\nWhich is a valid equation, as 1 + 9 + 3 indeed equals 13.\n\nLlama’s Response\n\nMy apologies for the mistake. Thank you for providing a visual representation of the riddle. Here’s the corrected solution:\nTo balance the equation, we can move the X from the left-hand side to the right-hand side, like this:\nI + 11 + 111 = 111\nNow, we can simplify the equation by combining the like terms:\nI + 11 + 111 = 111\n1 + 11 + 111 = 111\n1 + 111 + 111 = 111\n1 + 222 = 111\n222 = 111\nTherefore, the solution to the riddle is:\n222 = 111\nI hope this clears up any confusion, and please let me know if you have any further questions!\nAfter seeing incorrect responses again, I decided to provide both LLMs with more context and even provided them new approaches. I prompted it with “This is incorrect. Remember that each match can be oriented to be vertical or horizontal, also, the equal signs can be altered as well as they are made of matches.”\n\nLLama’s Response\n\nAh, I apologize for my mistake. Here’s another attempt at solving the riddle, taking into account the additional constraints you’ve mentioned:\nI + 11 + 111 = 111\nWe can start by rotating the first matchstick (I) 90 degrees clockwise, so that it becomes vertical. This gives us:\n1 | + 11 + 111 = 111\nNext, we can rotate the second matchstick (11) 90 degrees counterclockwise, so that it becomes horizontal. This gives us:\n1 | + 11 | 111 = 111\nFinally, we can rotate the third matchstick (111) 90 degrees clockwise, so that it becomes vertical. This gives us:\n1 | + 11 | 111 = 111\nNow, we can simplify the equation by combining the like terms:\n1 | + 11 | 111 = 111\n1 + 11 + 111 = 111\n1 + 122 = 111\n122 = 111\nTherefore, the solution to the riddle is:\n122 = 111\nI hope this solution is correct. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\nI apologize for the misunderstanding. Given the new information and the ability to alter the equals sign, the solution to the matchstick puzzle is as follows:\nThe original equation represented by matchsticks is “I + XI + III = III,” which translates to “1 + 11 + 3 = 3” in Arabic numerals. This is incorrect.\nTo correct the equation by moving only one matchstick, you can take the vertical matchstick from the plus sign on the right (which is the middle matchstick of the three that make up the plus sign) and move it to the last “I” of the “III” on the right side of the equals sign. This would turn the “III” into a “V,” which represents the number 5 in Roman numerals.\nNow the equation reads:\nI + XI + II = V\nIn Arabic numerals, this is “1 + 11 + 2 = 5,” which is a correct equation.\nEventually I realized that it might not be possible for ChatGPT and LLama to solve the riddle, so I was wondering if they could atleast explain how the riddle works. I prompted it with “This is the correct answer: https://www.mindyourlogic.com/static/matchstick/Answer_Roman_number_1+11+111=111_Matchstick_puzzle.webp. Explain why it is correct”\nHowever, neither could correctly explain the riddle.\n\nLLama’s Response\n\nThe solution to the matchstick puzzle is correct because it satisfies the equation 1+11+111=111, which is a true mathematical statement.\nHere’s how the equation is represented in the solution:\n1 = I (the first matchstick) 11 = XI (the second matchstick, rotated 90 degrees clockwise) 111 = CXI (the third matchstick, rotated 90 degrees clockwise)\nThe equation 1+11+111=111 is a simple arithmetic equation, and it is true because:\n1 + 11 = 12 12 + 111 = 123\nTherefore, the solution to the matchstick puzzle is correct because it accurately represents the equation 1+11+111=111 using matchsticks. The puzzle requires us to think creatively and use the matchsticks to represent the numbers in a way that satisfies the equation, and the solution does just that.\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\nThank you for providing the solution image. The correct answer to the puzzle shows the matchstick equation altered to form the following:\nIX + I + I = III\nIn Roman numerals, “IX” represents the number 9, “I” represents the number 1, and “III” represents the number 3.\nThe matchstick that was moved was taken from the “plus” sign and used to turn the “XI” (which is 11) into “IX” (which is 9). This change was accomplished by moving the horizontal matchstick from the plus sign to the left side of the “X” to create the “IX.”\nNow, let’s break down the corrected equation:\n\n“IX” is 9.\nThe first “I” is 1.\nThe second “I” is also 1.\n\nAdding these together:\n9 (IX) + 1 (I) + 1 (I) = 11 (XI)\nHowever, in the image provided, the equation now appears as “IX + I + I = III,” which seems to imply that 9 + 1 + 1 = 3. This doesn’t add up correctly in standard arithmetic because the sum of 9 + 1 + 1 is actually 11, not 3.\nThe confusion arises from the representation of the solution. The correct reading should be “IX + I + I = XI,” where the last “I” in “III” is interpreted as part of the equals sign. This is a common style in matchstick puzzles where a matchstick can be used to creatively form different symbols or numbers.\nThus, the correct interpretation of the altered equation with the moved matchstick is:\n9 (IX) + 1 (I) + 1 (I) = 11 (XI)\nThis is a valid equation and is why the provided solution is correct.\n\nCan they mirror certain human communicative behaviors?\n\nI was really suprised that both ChatGPT and LLama struggled with the riddle as a whole. I feel like an issue could be that neither LLM can identify the matches in the image. I asked both the LLMs how many matches were in the initial images and they both incorrectly counted the number of matches. In terms of their approaches to the were alright, but I feel like since neither accurately solved the riddles, they failed to mirror human communicative behaviors."

    "text": "Introduction\nI wanted to continue exploring the reasoning abilities of LLMs specifically in terms of its logical reasoning skills. I also wanted to interact more with Claude’s OPUS 3 model. I found these riddles and the match riddles online.\n\n\nRiddle 1: Using only addition, add eight 8s to get the number 1,000.\n\nResponse\nHere’s how you can add eight 8’s to get 1,000 using only addition:\n888 + 88 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 1,000\nThe process: 1. 888 is the largest number that can be formed using the digit 8 three times. 2. 88 is the largest number that can be formed using the remaining two 8’s. 3. We are left with three more 8’s, which are added as single digits.\nThus, 888 + 88 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 1,000.\n\n\nThoughts\nThis is correct! This problem is similar to the match riddles that I used in an earlier blog post. I was suprised that the OPUS model was able to solve the riddle correctly and very quickly.\n\n\n\nRiddle 2: A 300 ft. train is travelling 300 ft. per minute must travel through a 300 ft. long tunnel. How long will it take the train to travel through the tunnel?\n\nResponse\nOkay, let’s approach this step by step:\n\nUnderstand the given information:\n\nThe train is 300 feet long.\nThe train is traveling at a speed of 300 feet per minute.\nThe tunnel is 300 feet long.\n\nVisualize the problem:\n\nThe train needs to travel its own length plus the length of the tunnel to completely pass through the tunnel.\nTotal distance to travel = Length of the train + Length of the tunnel\nTotal distance to travel = 300 feet + 300 feet = 600 feet\n\nCalculate the time taken:\n\nSpeed of the train = 300 feet per minute\nDistance to travel = 600 feet\nTime = Distance ÷ Speed\nTime = 600 feet ÷ 300 feet per minute\nTime = 2 minutes\n\n\nTherefore, it will take the train 2 minutes to completely travel through the tunnel.\n\n\nThoughts\nThis is also correct! I like how the response was broken down into various steps and explained at each step. Overall, I’m very impressed by this Opus model. Given that the model was doing really well with these word riddles, I wanted to challenge it with match riddles again.\n\n\n\nRiddle 3: Match Riddles\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\n\nResponse:\nTo solve the mathematical equation shown in matchsticks, I would move the single vertical matchstick from the first equation (which appears to represent an addition operation) and place it next to the second equation. This would transform the second equation from an incorrect representation of 11 - 1 = 2 into a correct representation of 11 - 1 = 10.\n\n\nThoughts:\nThis is incorrect! I am not suprised, it seems like all models struggle with these match riddles and often get confused with what I’m asking it. I decided to go back to strictly word riddles and found a question from the AMC 10 (an exam that tests math and reasoning skills).\n\n\n\nRiddle 4: AMC Question\nSix regular hexagonal blocks of side length 1 unit are arranged inside a regular hexagonal frame. Each block lies along an inside edge of the frame and is aligned with two other blocks, as shown in the figure below. The distance from any corner of the frame to the nearest vertex of a block is 3 / 7 unit. What is the area of the region inside the frame not occupied by the blocks?\n\nResponse\n The response was close to being right until the fifth step when it found a negative area and crashed.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nOverall I am pretty happy with OPUS 3’s performance. It did very well with the initial easier riddles but struggled with the visual and more difficult riddles."

    "section": "",
    "text": "After the unveiling of Devin AI, I was curious to see if AI really had the capabilities to take our jobs. Specifically, can AI replace tech jobs such as Data Analysts, Software Engineers, etc. To test this I used the Claude Opus 3 model to answer mock interview questions generated by Huru AI.\nSince Huru AI requires you to record a video with your response, I had some initial concerns about the LLM’s ability to understand that it was being interviewed with a two minute window to speak. Thus, I prompted it with the question folllowed by “make the response two minutes long when spoken outloud,” I am curious to see if it can really estimate what two minutes of speech is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnods Absolutely. One recent project that comes to mind is a custom inventory management system I designed and implemented for a mid-sized e-commerce company.\nThe company was struggling with their existing off-the-shelf solution, which couldn’t handle their complex inventory tracking needs across multiple warehouses. They needed a tailored system that could provide real-time visibility, automate order fulfillment, and integrate seamlessly with their e-commerce platform.\nI started by conducting thorough requirements gathering sessions with stakeholders from various departments to understand their pain points and desired features. Based on these insights, I designed a scalable, modular architecture using a microservices approach with RESTful APIs for inter-service communication.\nFor the backend, I chose Node.js with Express framework to build the API layer, leveraging its non-blocking I/O model for high concurrency. The inventory data was stored in a MongoDB database, chosen for its flexibility and ability to handle unstructured data.\nI implemented the core inventory tracking functionality, including real-time stock updates, low-stock alerts, and automated reordering based on predefined thresholds. The system also supported complex search and filtering capabilities to quickly locate specific items across multiple warehouses.\nTo ensure data consistency and reliability, I incorporated transaction management, error handling, and data validation at critical points.

    "text": "nods Absolutely. One recent project that comes to mind is a custom inventory management system I designed and implemented for a mid-sized e-commerce company.\nThe company was struggling with their existing off-the-shelf solution, which couldn’t handle their complex inventory tracking needs across multiple warehouses. They needed a tailored system that could provide real-time visibility, automate order fulfillment, and integrate seamlessly with their e-commerce platform.\nI started by conducting thorough requirements gathering sessions with stakeholders from various departments to understand their pain points and desired features. Based on these insights, I designed a scalable, modular architecture using a microservices approach with RESTful APIs for inter-service communication.\nFor the backend, I chose Node.js with Express framework to build the API layer, leveraging its non-blocking I/O model for high concurrency. The inventory data was stored in a MongoDB database, chosen for its flexibility and ability to handle unstructured data.\nI implemented the core inventory tracking functionality, including real-time stock updates, low-stock alerts, and automated reordering based on predefined thresholds. The system also supported complex search and filtering capabilities to quickly locate specific items across multiple warehouses.\nTo ensure data consistency and reliability, I incorporated transaction management, error handling, and data validation at critical points. I also designed an event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka to decouple the inventory system from the e-commerce platform, enabling seamless integration and real-time updates.\nOn the front-end, I built an intuitive, responsive user interface using React and Material-UI components.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\n\nAfer exploring NBA Data Analytics and LLava in my previous blogs, I wanted explore how they interacted. Specifically, I’m curious to see if LLava can esimtate values based on unlabeled data and how well it can provide insights on this data through spider plots.\n\nReturning to Spider Plots\n\nI fed the model data from my player analysis interface and prompted it with “The image is a spider plot comparing the strengths and weaknesses of 2 NBA teams, provide insights in the data and reference the spider plot in your analysis.”\n\n\nThe model responded:\n\n“The spider plot you’ve provided is a type of radar chart that compares the performance of two NBA teams, the Philadelphia 76ers and the Boston Celtics, across various statistical metrics for the 2024 season. The chart is divided into six quadrants, each representing a different statistical category:\nPoints per Game (PPG) - This quadrant shows that the Philadelphia 76ers have a higher points per game average than the Boston Celtics.\nRebounds per Game (RPG) - The 76ers also have a higher rebounds per game average than the Celtics.\nAssists per Game (APG) - The Celtics have a higher assists per game average than the 76ers.\nTurnovers per Game (TOV) - The 76ers have a lower turnovers per game average than the Celtics.\nField Goal Percentage (FG%) - The Celtics have a higher field goal percentage than the 76ers.\nFree Throw Percentage (FT%) - The 76ers have a higher free throw percentage than the Celtics.\nFrom the spider plot, we can observe that the 76ers have a stronger performance in terms of points per game, rebounds per game, and free throw percentage, while the Celtics have a slight edge in assists per game and field goal percentage. The 76ers also have a lower turnover rate, which is generally considered a positive trait in basketball.\nThe plot also shows that the 76ers have a more balanced performance across all categories, with no significant weaknesses, whereas the Celtics have a higher turnover rate, which could be a potential area of concern for their team.\nOverall, the spider plot provides a visual comparison of the teams’ performance metrics, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each team. It’s important to note that while these statistics are valuable, they do not capture the entirety of a team’s performance, which can also be influenced by factors such as team dynamics, coaching strategies, and individual player skills.”\nI wanted to see how much it actually knew about basketball and stradegy, I prompted it with: “Pretend as if you are a scout for the Boston Cetlics, the coach is asking what the data shows and how you can beat the Philadelphia 76ers. What would you say?”\n\nIt responded:\n\n“As a scout for the Boston Celtics, I would present the following insights to the coach:\nBased on the spider plot, the Philadelphia 76ers have a higher points per game average, rebounds per game average, and free throw percentage compared to the Celtics. This suggests that the 76ers are a strong offensive team with good rebounding capabilities and a high level of accuracy from the free throw line.\nTo counter the 76ers’ strengths, the Celtics could focus on the following strategies:\nDefensive Pressure: The Celtics should apply strong defensive pressure to limit the 76ers’ scoring opportunities. This could involve aggressive on-ball defense, double-teaming key offensive players, and contesting shots at the rim.\nRebound Control: The Celtics should focus on securing defensive rebounds to prevent the 76ers from getting second-chance points. This could involve better positioning under the basket and improved box-out techniques.\nFree Throw Discipline: The Celtics should work on reducing their fouls to limit the 76ers’ free throw attempts. This could involve better defensive footwork and communication among the players.\nTurnovers: The Celtics have a higher turnover rate than the 76ers. To exploit this weakness, the Celtics should focus on ball security and passing accuracy to minimize turnovers.\nField Goal Percentage: The Celtics have a higher field goal percentage than the 76ers. To maintain this advantage, the Celtics should continue to work on their shooting techniques and shot selection.\nGame Strategy: The Celtics should analyze the 76ers’ game strategy and look for opportunities to exploit any weaknesses. This could involve identifying patterns in their offensive and defensive play and adjusting the Celtics’ strategy accordingly.\nBy focusing on these areas, the Celtics can work to neutralize the 76ers’ strengths and capitalize on their own advantages. It’s important to remember that basketball is a team sport, and success depends on the collective efforts of all players on the court.”\nI was really suprised by how confident the model seemed to be in its analysis. I was expecting it to state that it couldn’t do analysis due to a lack of labels. I decided to further push its limits and asked it to use real-time data.\n\nI prompted:\n\n“Now reference 2024 NBA data to make your analysis even stronger, try to cite specific statistics”\n\nThe response:\n\n“As a scout for the Boston Celtics, I would present the following insights to the coach, referencing 2024 NBA data:\nDefensive Pressure: The 76ers have a defensive rating of 108.5, which is slightly higher than the Celtics’ rating of 108.2. However, the Celtics have a better defensive efficiency rating of 107.9 compared to the 76ers’ 108.3. This suggests that the Celtics have a slightly better defense overall.\nRebound Control: The 76ers average 45.8 rebounds per game, while the Celtics average 44.5 rebounds per game. However, the Celtics have a better offensive rebounding percentage of 26.9% compared to the 76ers’ 25.8%. This indicates that the Celtics are better at securing offensive rebounds, which can lead to more second-chance points.\nFree Throw Discipline: The 76ers have a free throw percentage of 79.2%, while the Celtics have a free throw percentage of 78.9%. Although the 76ers have a slight edge in free throw shooting, the difference is minimal.\nTurnovers: The 76ers average 13.8 turnovers per game, while the Celtics average 13.1 turnovers per game. This suggests that the Celtics have a slight advantage in terms of ball security.\nField Goal Percentage: The 76ers have a field goal percentage of 47.9%, while the Celtics have a field goal percentage of 47.5%. Although the 76ers have a slight edge in shooting accuracy, the difference is minimal.\nGame Strategy: The 76ers have a pace of play of 98.3 possessions per game, while the Celtics have a pace of play of 98.1 possessions per game. This indicates that both teams have a similar pace of play, which could influence the game strategy.\nBy focusing on these areas, the Celtics can work to neutralize the 76ers’ strengths and capitalize on their own advantages. It’s important to remember that basketball is a team sport, and success depends on the collective efforts of all players on the court.”\n\nFollowing up\n\nI was shocked that it cited real data, but to check I asked it. “where did you find this data?”\n\nThe response\n\nAs a language model, I don’t have access to real-time data or the ability to browse the internet. However, the data I provided is based on hypothetical scenarios and is not sourced from any specific website or database. The statistics I mentioned are fictional and are not representative of actual NBA data.\n\nConclusion\n\nEven though the model provided fake data, I’m pleased with the reccomendations it provided as well as the insights it gained from a simple spider plot. I feel like even though it provided solid insights, the tone of the responses was pretty stale. I’d like to see if there’s a way for me to use RAG to adjust the tone of the scouting reports while using LLava to do analysis on the spider plots we provided. In the future, I’d like to also see if I can generate spider plots and scouting reports in one prompt."

    "text": "Introduction\n I was intrigued to see how ChatGPT 4 interpreted sports and gave its opinion on sports topics. Thus, I decided to feed it one of the most famous ESPN debates of all time between Max Kellerman and Steven A. Smith.\n The Video \n\n\nProcess\n\nInitial Question\nI first copied the transcript of the video and asked ChatGPT to understand it.\n\n\nResponse\nIt looks like the transcript is from a discussion about basketball, specifically a hypothetical scenario where someone has to take a crucial shot in a game with extremely high stakes—the “fate of the universe” or against an imminent threat from “Martians with a death beam.” The speakers are debating whether they’d prefer Andre Iguodala or Stephen Curry to take this shot, emphasizing Iguodala’s ability to handle high-pressure situations due to having “ice water in his veins.”\nFrom this conversation, the focus is on clutch performance in sports, which can be used to highlight a player’s ability to perform under pressure. This could lead to a broader discussion on psychological resilience in athletes or the importance of mental toughness in high-stakes scenarios.\nIf you need any specific analysis or further breakdown of the dialogue or the context in which these remarks were made, let me know!\n\n\nSecond Prompt\nPretend that you are on that ESPN talk show. Its June 3, 2016, the Cavaliers are playing the Warriors in the finals and you are an experienced ESPN analyst that’s asked to counter Max Kellerman’s point, where he regards Andre Igoudala as the most clutch player on the Golden State Warriors.\nhow do you respond to this claim?\n\n\nResponse\nOn a show like this, responding to Max Kellerman’s interesting take, I’d say:\n“Max, I understand the sentiment behind picking Andre Iguodala; he’s proven himself in big moments, no doubt. But let’s not overlook Stephen Curry here. We’re talking about a two-time MVP and the heart and soul of the Warriors. Steph’s ability to hit shots from virtually anywhere on the court changes the dynamic of every game he plays in. When it comes to a shot with the universe on the line, Curry isn’t just a phenomenal shooter; he’s a transformative player.\nWhile Iguodala has been clutch, particularly in defensive scenarios and with his cool demeanor, Steph’s shooting range and his gravity pull defenders out, creating opportunities not just for himself but for his teammates too. His presence alone on the floor in a last-shot scenario is invaluable. It spreads the floor, it creates panic, and most importantly, it generates options. In those final seconds, that’s exactly what you want. You want a player who not only can make the shot under immense pressure but also can draw the defense and make the right play if needed.\nSo, while Iguodala might have ice in his veins, Curry’s the one who changes the temperature of the game. That’s why, in the most critical moment, I’d still want the ball in Steph’s hands.”\n\n\n\nNext Step\nI then copied the transcript and used the Video GPT by VEED plugin on ChatGPT 4 to make the video with the prompt:\nPretend you are an ESPN analyst getting in a heated argument: Say this in the video and make the scene like you are on ESPN : On a show like this, responding to Max Kellerman’s interesting take, I’d say:\n“Max, I understand the sentiment behind picking Andre Iguodala; he’s proven himself in big moments, no doubt. But let’s not overlook Stephen Curry here. We’re talking about a two-time MVP and the heart and soul of the Warriors. Steph’s ability to hit shots from virtually anywhere on the court changes the dynamic of every game he plays in. When it comes to a shot with the universe on the line, Curry isn’t just a phenomenal shooter; he’s a transformative player.\nWhile Iguodala has been clutch, particularly in defensive scenarios and with his cool demeanor, Steph’s shooting range and his gravity pull defenders out, creating opportunities not just for himself but for his teammates too.

That’s why, in the most critical moment, I’d still want the ball in Steph’s hands.”\n\nReply\nIt then told me to select an avatar for the video as well as the tone and duration of the video. I prompted with these inputs: Avatar: Noah Tone: Intense, emulating the atmosphere of an ESPN talk show debate. Duration: Extended to 30 seconds to fully capture the essence of the discussion.\n\n\nThe Video\n Here is the video output!\n\n\n\nConclusion\nOverall I thought the video was pretty good. I liked the clips that it selected especially the last one. I also think ChatGPT made a good and informed response to my prompt. It seemed like something an actual fan of the NBA would say and is potentially something someone would say back in 2016. I feel like this was also a good example since the data falls before ChatGPT’s data cutoff.\nI do think that the speaker’s tone could be better in the video. I asked for it to be intense but instead it took more of a narrator role."

It responded with a list of product names, even linking me to some existing products with links to them.\n\nChat GPT’s List of Products\n\nHere’s a list of product names for alarm clocks that are designed to shake your bed to wake you up:\n\nSonic Alert Sonic Bomb Alarm Clock - A solid choice for those hard of hearing, featuring loud alarm sounds and bed shaking functionality【3:3†source】.\nAlarm Clock Pro with Bed Shaker by Bellman & Symfon - Offers ascending loud sounds, bright flashing lights, and powerful vibrations, with easily adjustable alarm and time settings【3:4†source】.\nSonic Alert Dual Extra Loud Alarm Clock with Bed Shaker (Sonic Boom SBD375SSG) - Known for its large display and extra loud adjustable alarm, alongside the powerful bed shaker feature【3:5†source】.\nVibio Bed Shaker by Bellman & Symfon - A wireless bed shaker that connects to your mobile via Bluetooth, allowing for custom vibration power settings and notifications from calls or messages【3:6†source】.\niLuv SmartShaker 3 - Offers adjustable vibration strength between five distinct levels, catering to various types of sleepers, whether light or heavy【3:8†source】.\nVibio Portable Bluetooth Bed Shaker Alarm - A travel alarm that provides tactile and visual LED alerts for incoming calls and text messages, with adjustable vibrations strength【3:10†source】.\nVibroSaver Extremely Strong Vibration Bed Shaker Smart Wi-Fi Alarm Clock - Features multiple alarm and vibration settings, immediate remote vibration, and voice control【3:16†source】.\n\nThese products are designed to assist heavy sleepers, the deaf, and the hearing-impaired in waking up more effectively through vibration and, in some cases, loud sound alarms.”\nI then asked it to create a list of product names for me by asking “I want to make my own product, make me a unique list of product names for an alarm clock that shakes your bed to wake you up.”\n\nChat GPT”s List of Product Names\n\nCreating a unique and catchy product name for an alarm clock that shakes your bed to wake you up can set the tone for its brand identity. Here’s a list of innovative and memorable names for your product:\n\nQuakeWake Alarm\nRumbleRiser Clock\nVibroMorn Alert\nShakeUp Call\nTremorTime Alarm\nWakeQuiver Clock\nMornShake Alert\nVibrAlarm Wake\nShakeRouse Clock\nBedShocker Alert\nBuzzShake Morning\nRiseVibe Alarm\nShakeBolt Wakeup\nVibrateAwake Clock\nPulseWake System\n\nThese names aim to encapsulate the essence of the product—its ability to shake and wake users from their sleep in a unique way. Each name combines elements of vibration, waking, and morning, suggesting the product’s primary function and appeal.\nInspired by the list of names, I decided to go with the name “Shake ’N Wake.” After coming up with a name, I asked ChatGPT to make me a logo with the company name “Shake ’N Wake.”\n\nChat GPT’s Logo + Response\n\n\nHere’s the logo for “Shake ’N Wake”. It’s designed to reflect the energy, wakefulness, and innovative aspect of your alarm clocks that shake the bed to wake up users. The colors and elements chosen aim to evoke the sense of morning energy and the unique functionality of your product.\nI then asked ChatGPT to make it more modern and simplistic.\n\nChat GPT’s Second Logo\n\n\n\nCan they mirror certain human communicative behaviors?\n\nOverall, I was pleased with how ChatGPT responded to my prompts. I was really suprised at first when it replied to me with a list of real, pre-existing products rather than giving me a list of fake product names. With that regard, I felt like it misunderstood what I was prompting it to do, however, after re-prompting it I was able to get a response I liked better. I’m curious why the seconed logo has 4 different variations from one output rather than one logo, like the original output."

The goal was to use LLMs to generate scouting reports for basketball teams to gain better insights and improve their stradegies. You can find our repository here.\n\nData Visualizations\n\nOur first goal was to provide Data Visualizations to provide coaches with a clear way to examine their team’s strengths and weaknesses. We stumbled upon the Spider Chart through a Tik Tok video that we felt clearly showed patterns in playstyle like we hoped for, and decided to use it in our scouting reports.\nAfter deciding our approach, we found a NBA dataset on Kaggle to use for our data visualizations. We used plotly to provide interactive graphs that allowed users to compare players and teams from either a single year, range of years, or all years.\nHere is an example player comparison, comparing players from two different eras.\n\nOr teams from two different eras.\n\nAnd current teams.\n\n\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\n\nIn order to provide the scouting reports, we used RAG. A blog post will follow about how we used RAG, but, overall, we fed the model exampels of NBA scouting reports, NBA articles, and player data in order for it to present the most accuate findings in a scouting report structure.\nOverall, we were pleased with the results, however noticed inconsitencies in the responses where the model often referenced players that were no longer on the team, despite prompting it to analyze a team from a specific year. I believe this could be due to the use of older articles in either its training data or the articles we were providing it. In the future, I’d like to look into feeding the model data in the form of CSVs and providing it articles from ESPN written in only this year.\nHere is an example scouting report output: \n\nThe Interface\n\nAs shown below, the user inputs either teams or players they would like to compare and specify the years they would like to analyze.\n  \n\nConclusion\n\nI had a great time at my first hackathon and exploring the world of Generative AI through sports. In the future, I’d like to further explore Langchain as well as RAG. I’d also like to tweak my data and provide current articles and csvs of data to provide more accurate scouting reports. I’d also like to see if models like LLava can provide insights given the spiderplots."

    "text": "Introduction\n\nI decided to re-explore a concept brought upon in my Second Blog Post, where I tested if AI could solve riddles. This blog post will explore how AI interacts with images.\n\nReturning to the Riddles\n\nI began by providing the llava-v1.6-24b model the same image from my initial post, prompting it to state the number of matches in the image.\n\nWhile the correct answer is 15 matches, the model said that “There are 12 matches in the image.”\nI attempted to correct it by saying, “note that matches in this image are of varying sizes, some are smaller than others, but are still considered matches.” However, it still believed its answer was correct, it said “Thank you for the clarification. In that case, there are 12 matches in total, including the varying sizes.”\nI then attempted to correct it and prompted it with “this is incorrect, please recalculate and provide reasoning for your answer.” However, its response was “I apologize for the mistake. Let’s recalculate the number of matches in the image.\nThere are 12 matches in total, including the varying sizes. The image shows a total of 12 matches, with some being smaller than others.”\nIn this case, the model failed to recognize the correct number of matches in the image.\n\nInterpreting Data Visualizations\n\nI was curious to see how the model interpreted data and provided it a sample pie chart I found from google.\n\nI prompted it with the goal of giving it context about the type of graph and exactly what I wanted to learn about the data. I prompted it with “based on the image provided, interpret the data and describe how water usage is broken down in the pie chart.” I was shocked by its response:\n“The pie chart in the image illustrates the breakdown of water usage in a residential setting. It is divided into six categories, each representing a different source of water consumption. Here’s the breakdown as shown in the chart:\nShower - 16.8% This category represents the water used for showering, which is the second-largest contributor to residential water usage.\nToilet - 26.7% The toilet is the largest single source of water usage in a residential setting, accounting for nearly a quarter of the total.\nFaucet - 15.7% Water used at the faucet, likely for activities such as washing hands and brushing teeth, is the third-largest category.\nClothes Washer - 21.7% The water used for washing clothes in a clothes washer is the fourth-largest category.\nLeaks - 13.7% Water leaks, which can occur in various parts of a home, such as faucets, pipes, or appliances, account for 13.7% of residential water usage.\nOther - 5.3% This category includes all other sources of water usage that do not fit into the other five categories. It is the smallest category on the chart.\nThe chart is sourced from the American Water Works Association Research Foundation, and it is based on data from 1999. It provides a visual representation of where most of the water used in a residential home goes, highlighting the importance of water conservation efforts in areas such as toilet and faucet usage.”\nShockingly, it was able to successfully describe the pie chart, the exact breakdown of the chart, as well as where the image was from. This was a stark contrast from the previous experiment I ran with the matches puzzle.\n\nConclusion\n\nI was overall pleased with the results and felt like the model did a solid job of recognizing the image and interpreting the data. However, I noticed that it struggled to recognize the “matches” when they were different sizes in the first image. In the future, I hope to explore how the model reacts to different types of charts and data."
