Here we go:\nText for the Children’s Picture Book Title: The Magical World of AI and the Wise Owls\nPage 1: In a faraway land filled with wonder and magic, there lived smart creatures known as the Wise Owls. These owls were very special because they could understand and speak any language!\nImage: A colorful forest with various animals, and in the center, an owl wearing glasses and surrounded by books.\nPage 2: The Wise Owls were part of something much bigger, a magical world called Artificial Intelligence, or AI for short. AI is like a fairy tale come to life, where machines can learn and do things just like humans.\nImage: A majestic tree with branches representing different magical abilities, like speaking, seeing, and solving puzzles. An owl is perched on each branch.\nPage 3: One of the most magical spells in this world was called LLM, which stands for Large Language Model. These spells allowed the Wise Owls to listen carefully and give the best answers they could.\nImage: A group of owls sitting around a crystal ball, filled with swirling letters and words, casting a spell together.\nPage 4: Imagine you asked, “Why is the sky blue?” A Wise Owl would whisper to the wind, gather the words from their magical spell, and tell you a story about the sun and the earth that makes the sky look blue.\nImage: A curious child asking an owl a question, with the owl responding. The background shows a whimsical interpretation of the sky and sun.\nPage 5: The Wise Owls learned from the biggest library ever, with books about everything from ants to galaxies. But instead of turning pages, they would magically absorb all the knowledge.\nImage: An enormous, enchanting library with books flying into the minds of the owls.\nPage 6: Sometimes, even Wise Owls need to learn more. If they don’t know something, they say, “Let’s discover it together!” because learning is an adventure that never ends.\nImage: An owl and a child holding hands, walking towards a treasure chest that glows with new knowledge.\nPage 7: The Wise Owls always remind us that the magic of AI is very powerful. It can create wonderful things, solve tricky problems, and make the world a better place if used with kindness and care.\nImage: Different animals using gadgets and screens, showing happy faces as owls help them understand and solve problems.\nPage 8: And so, in the magical world of AI and the Wise Owls, every day is a chance to learn something new, to help others, and to imagine the endless possibilities that tomorrow can bring.\nImage: A vibrant sunset over the magical forest, with all the animals and owls looking up at the sky, dreaming about the future.\nNow, let’s create an image based on the first page to start this magical journey.\nLet’s generate an image for Page 1:\nA colorful forest with various animals, and in the center, an owl wearing glasses and surrounded by books. This owl looks wise and welcoming, inviting everyone into the magical world of AI. The forest is vibrant with greens, blues, and a variety of animals peeking from behind the trees, intrigued by the owl’s knowledge.\nA colorful forest with various animals, and in the center, an owl wearing glasses and surrounded by books. This owl looks wise and welcoming, inviting everyone into the magical world of AI. The forest is vibrant with greens, blues, and a variety of animals peeking from behind the trees, intrigued by the owl’s knowledge. Here’s the first page of our magical journey into the world of AI and the Wise Owls. This image sets the scene for our children’s picture book, introducing the magical forest where our story begins. You can use this image to help illustrate the story and capture the imagination of young readers.\nIf you’d like to continue with illustrations for the rest of the pages or need further adjustments, feel free to let me know!\n\nComments\n\nOverall, I’m happy with the text output and am impressed with the structure of the output, especially since it provided me everything I wanted with page text and image description, then outputting the images. However, I noticed that the output is not perfect. For example, the images do not maintain the same art style and fail to correctly replicate human writing/text in the images. In the future, I’d like to explore if ChatGPT can use consistent art styles and correct texts in its images."

    "text": "After the unveiling of Devin AI, I was curious to see if AI really had the capabilities to take our jobs. Specifically, can AI replace tech jobs such as Data Analysts, Software Engineers, etc. To test this I used the Claude Opus 3 model to answer mock interview questions generated by Huru AI.\nSince Huru AI requires you to record a video with your response, I had some initial concerns about the LLM’s ability to understand that it was being interviewed with a two minute window to speak. Thus, I prompted it with the question folllowed by “make the response two minutes long when spoken outloud,” I am curious to see if it can really estimate what two minutes of speech is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnods Absolutely. One recent project that comes to mind is a custom inventory management system I designed and implemented for a mid-sized e-commerce company.\nThe company was struggling with their existing off-the-shelf solution, which couldn’t handle their complex inventory tracking needs across multiple warehouses. They needed a tailored system that could provide real-time visibility, automate order fulfillment, and integrate seamlessly with their e-commerce platform.\nI started by conducting thorough requirements gathering sessions with stakeholders from various departments to understand their pain points and desired features. Based on these insights, I designed a scalable, modular architecture using a microservices approach with RESTful APIs for inter-service communication.\nFor the backend, I chose Node.js with Express framework to build the API layer, leveraging its non-blocking I/O model for high concurrency. The inventory data was stored in a MongoDB database, chosen for its flexibility and ability to handle unstructured data.\nI implemented the core inventory tracking functionality, including real-time stock updates, low-stock alerts, and automated reordering based on predefined thresholds. The system also supported complex search and filtering capabilities to quickly locate specific items across multiple warehouses.\nTo ensure data consistency and reliability, I incorporated transaction management, error handling, and data validation at critical points. I also designed an event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka to decouple the inventory system from the e-commerce platform, enabling seamless integration and real-time updates.\nOn the front-end, I built an intuitive, responsive user interface using React and Material-UI components. The UI allowed warehouse managers to easily view, update, and manage inventory levels, as well as generate reports and insights.\nThroughout the development process, I followed agile methodologies, working in sprints and collaborating closely with the client’s team. (WAS ONLY ABLE TO GET TO HERE UNTIL IT WAS CUT OFF)\nI conducted regular code reviews, wrote comprehensive unit and integration tests, and ensured the codebase was maintainable and well-documented.\nAfter a series of iterative development cycles and thorough testing, the inventory management system was successfully deployed to production. It significantly streamlined the company’s inventory tracking processes, reduced manual errors, and improved order fulfillment efficiency. The modular architecture also allowed for easy scalability and integration with future systems.\nOverall, this project showcased my ability to design and implement a robust, custom software solution from scratch, tailored to the client’s specific business needs. It highlighted my skills in requirements gathering, system architecture, full-stack development, and project management.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour response is excellent and articulates your skills, expertise, and approach to project execution in detail. You’ve done a great job providing a comprehensive walk-through of a recent project, explaining why specific technologies were chosen, outlining the problem you were solving, your methodology, and the resulting outcomes. One minor improvement could be mentioning any challenges you faced during the implementation phase and how you overcame them, as this could be an essential aspect interviewers may want to hear. Excellent job overall!\n\n\n\nYou provided a very detailed and thorough answer, which perfectly sets out your skills and expertise. However, there are some minor grammatical issues. Instead of “conducting thorough requirements”, use “conducting thorough requirements-gathering sessions”. Instead of “closing with teams and clients”, use “close collaboration with teams and clients”. Lastly, instead of “wrote comprehensive unit integration tests”, it should be “wrote comprehensive unit and integration tests”. Your use of technical jargon displays your knowledge, but make sure the interviewer can follow your traın of thought\n\n\n\nYour answer comes across as confident and deep in detail. You show a clear understanding of your project and displayed very strong technical competency. You also show commendable control over your narrative, which is a reflection of a levelled confidence. Well done!\n\n\n\n\nI thought it was really interesting that the LLM “nods” at the start of the response, showing that maybe it misunderstood my prompt. It also seems like the LLM overestimated the amount of words I could speak in 2 minutes. I like Huru’s analysis of the answer to question 1, but it seems like it misunderstood what I was saying at times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen faced with complex programming issues, my approach to problem-solving involves several key steps. First, I take the time to thoroughly understand the problem at hand, breaking it down into smaller, more manageable components. This allows me to identify the root cause of the issue and develop a clear picture of what needs to be addressed.\nNext, I draw upon my experience and knowledge to consider potential solutions. I think about similar challenges I’ve encountered in the past and how I successfully resolved them. I also consider best practices and design patterns that could be applied to the current situation.\nIf the problem is particularly complex or novel, I’m not afraid to conduct research and consult with colleagues or online resources to gather additional insights and perspectives. Collaborating with others often leads to innovative solutions that I may not have considered on my own.\nOnce I have a few potential solutions in mind, I evaluate each one carefully, considering factors such as feasibility, performance, scalability, and maintainability. I weigh the pros and cons of each approach and select the one that best addresses the problem while aligning with the project’s goals and constraints.\nFinally, I implement the chosen solution incrementally, testing thoroughly at each stage to ensure that it effectively resolves the issue without introducing new problems. I document my work clearly so that others can understand and maintain the code in the future.\nThroughout the problem-solving process, I maintain a positive attitude and remain open to feedback and suggestions from others. I believe that continuous learning and adaptation are essential for success in the ever-evolving field of software development.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour answer provides a comprehensive understanding of your approach to problem-solving, especially when it comes to dealing with complex programming issues. It is commendable that you have demonstrated a systematic way of resolving these issues, from understanding the problem, considering potential solutions, evaluating each solution based on certain factors, to implementing the chosen solution. You’ve clearly shown your technical skills, critical thinking, and collaboration. Your emphasis on continuous learning, adaptation, and maintaining a positive attitude throughout the process is also beneficial in the workplace. Excellent job.\n\n\n\nYour response was very thorough and displayed confidence. It showed you understand problem-solving processes well. However, it seemed slightly rehearsed and textbook-like. While clear and methodic, your response could have displayed more self-assurance, especially when discussing your ability to collaborate and adapt.\n\n\n\nYour response was comprehensive and well-structured, showcasing your problem-solving capabilities effectively. However, there are some areas where clarity can be improved. Instead of saying “when it needs to be addressed,” say “what needs to be addressed,” to establish clear specificity. Moreover, avoid redundant sentences like “I document my work clearly so that I can understand and maintain the code in the future.” It is assumed you will understand your own coding work without documentation, so say, “I document my work clearly for future reference and ease of maintenance.” Lastly, instead of saying “I believe that this continuous learning and adaptation are essential for our success,” say “I believe that continuous learning and adaptation are essential for success.” This simplifies your statement and removes any confusion or ambiguity.\n\n\n\n\nThis response was a little better in terms of time, I was able to say it all in 1 minute and 30 seconds. I also thought that the analysis was good but still has similar issues of misunderstanding what I said."

    "text": "Introduction\n\nAfer exploring NBA Data Analytics and LLava in my previous blogs, I wanted explore how they interacted. Specifically, I’m curious to see if LLava can esimtate values based on unlabeled data and how well it can provide insights on this data through spider plots.\n\nReturning to Spider Plots\n\nI fed the model data from my player analysis interface and prompted it with “The image is a spider plot comparing the strengths and weaknesses of 2 NBA teams, provide insights in the data and reference the spider plot in your analysis.”\n\n\nThe model responded:\n\n“The spider plot you’ve provided is a type of radar chart that compares the performance of two NBA teams, the Philadelphia 76ers and the Boston Celtics, across various statistical metrics for the 2024 season. The chart is divided into six quadrants, each representing a different statistical category:\nPoints per Game (PPG) - This quadrant shows that the Philadelphia 76ers have a higher points per game average than the Boston Celtics.\nRebounds per Game (RPG) - The 76ers also have a higher rebounds per game average than the Celtics.\nAssists per Game (APG) - The Celtics have a higher assists per game average than the 76ers.\nTurnovers per Game (TOV) - The 76ers have a lower turnovers per game average than the Celtics.\nField Goal Percentage (FG%) - The Celtics have a higher field goal percentage than the 76ers.\nFree Throw Percentage (FT%) - The 76ers have a higher free throw percentage than the Celtics.\nFrom the spider plot, we can observe that the 76ers have a stronger performance in terms of points per game, rebounds per game, and free throw percentage, while the Celtics have a slight edge in assists per game and field goal percentage. The 76ers also have a lower turnover rate, which is generally considered a positive trait in basketball.\nThe plot also shows that the 76ers have a more balanced performance across all categories, with no significant weaknesses, whereas the Celtics have a higher turnover rate, which could be a potential area of concern for their team.\nOverall, the spider plot provides a visual comparison of the teams’ performance metrics, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each team. It’s important to note that while these statistics are valuable, they do not capture the entirety of a team’s performance, which can also be influenced by factors such as team dynamics, coaching strategies, and individual player skills.”\nI wanted to see how much it actually knew about basketball and stradegy, I prompted it with: “Pretend as if you are a scout for the Boston Cetlics, the coach is asking what the data shows and how you can beat the Philadelphia 76ers. What would you say?”\n\nIt responded:\n\n“As a scout for the Boston Celtics, I would present the following insights to the coach:\nBased on the spider plot, the Philadelphia 76ers have a higher points per game average, rebounds per game average, and free throw percentage compared to the Celtics. This suggests that the 76ers are a strong offensive team with good rebounding capabilities and a high level of accuracy from the free throw line.\nTo counter the 76ers’ strengths, the Celtics could focus on the following strategies:\nDefensive Pressure: The Celtics should apply strong defensive pressure to limit the 76ers’ scoring opportunities. This could involve aggressive on-ball defense, double-teaming key offensive players, and contesting shots at the rim.\nRebound Control: The Celtics should focus on securing defensive rebounds to prevent the 76ers from getting second-chance points. This could involve better positioning under the basket and improved box-out techniques.\nFree Throw Discipline: The Celtics should work on reducing their fouls to limit the 76ers’ free throw attempts. This could involve better defensive footwork and communication among the players.\nTurnovers: The Celtics have a higher turnover rate than the 76ers. To exploit this weakness, the Celtics should focus on ball security and passing accuracy to minimize turnovers.\nField Goal Percentage: The Celtics have a higher field goal percentage than the 76ers. To maintain this advantage, the Celtics should continue to work on their shooting techniques and shot selection.\nGame Strategy: The Celtics should analyze the 76ers’ game strategy and look for opportunities to exploit any weaknesses. This could involve identifying patterns in their offensive and defensive play and adjusting the Celtics’ strategy accordingly.\nBy focusing on these areas, the Celtics can work to neutralize the 76ers’ strengths and capitalize on their own advantages. It’s important to remember that basketball is a team sport, and success depends on the collective efforts of all players on the court.”\nI was really suprised by how confident the model seemed to be in its analysis. I was expecting it to state that it couldn’t do analysis due to a lack of labels. I decided to further push its limits and asked it to use real-time data.\n\nI prompted:\n\n“Now reference 2024 NBA data to make your analysis even stronger, try to cite specific statistics”\n\nThe response:\n\n“As a scout for the Boston Celtics, I would present the following insights to the coach, referencing 2024 NBA data:\nDefensive Pressure: The 76ers have a defensive rating of 108.5, which is slightly higher than the Celtics’ rating of 108.2. However, the Celtics have a better defensive efficiency rating of 107.9 compared to the 76ers’ 108.3. This suggests that the Celtics have a slightly better defense overall.\nRebound Control: The 76ers average 45.8 rebounds per game, while the Celtics average 44.5 rebounds per game. However, the Celtics have a better offensive rebounding percentage of 26.9% compared to the 76ers’ 25.8%. This indicates that the Celtics are better at securing offensive rebounds, which can lead to more second-chance points.\nFree Throw Discipline: The 76ers have a free throw percentage of 79.2%, while the Celtics have a free throw percentage of 78.9%. Although the 76ers have a slight edge in free throw shooting, the difference is minimal.\nTurnovers: The 76ers average 13.8 turnovers per game, while the Celtics average 13.1 turnovers per game. This suggests that the Celtics have a slight advantage in terms of ball security.\nField Goal Percentage: The 76ers have a field goal percentage of 47.9%, while the Celtics have a field goal percentage of 47.5%. Although the 76ers have a slight edge in shooting accuracy, the difference is minimal.\nGame Strategy: The 76ers have a pace of play of 98.3 possessions per game, while the Celtics have a pace of play of 98.1 possessions per game. This indicates that both teams have a similar pace of play, which could influence the game strategy.\nBy focusing on these areas, the Celtics can work to neutralize the 76ers’ strengths and capitalize on their own advantages. It’s important to remember that basketball is a team sport, and success depends on the collective efforts of all players on the court.”\n\nFollowing up\n\nI was shocked that it cited real data, but to check I asked it. “where did you find this data?”\n\nThe response\n\nAs a language model, I don’t have access to real-time data or the ability to browse the internet. However, the data I provided is based on hypothetical scenarios and is not sourced from any specific website or database. The statistics I mentioned are fictional and are not representative of actual NBA data.\n\nConclusion\n\nEven though the model provided fake data, I’m pleased with the reccomendations it provided as well as the insights it gained from a simple spider plot. I feel like even though it provided solid insights, the tone of the responses was pretty stale. I’d like to see if there’s a way for me to use RAG to adjust the tone of the scouting reports while using LLava to do analysis on the spider plots we provided. In the future, I’d like to also see if I can generate spider plots and scouting reports in one prompt."

Being a fully-rookie team, my group quickly found used our interests in the intersections of Data Analytics and Basketball to create a project. The goal was to use LLMs to generate scouting reports for basketball teams to gain better insights and improve their stradegies. You can find our repository here.\n\nData Visualizations\n\nOur first goal was to provide Data Visualizations to provide coaches with a clear way to examine their team’s strengths and weaknesses. We stumbled upon the Spider Chart through a Tik Tok video that we felt clearly showed patterns in playstyle like we hoped for, and decided to use it in our scouting reports.\nAfter deciding our approach, we found a NBA dataset on Kaggle to use for our data visualizations. We used plotly to provide interactive graphs that allowed users to compare players and teams from either a single year, range of years, or all years.\nHere is an example player comparison, comparing players from two different eras.\n\nOr teams from two different eras.\n\nAnd current teams.\n\n\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\n\nIn order to provide the scouting reports, we used RAG. A blog post will follow about how we used RAG, but, overall, we fed the model exampels of NBA scouting reports, NBA articles, and player data in order for it to present the most accuate findings in a scouting report structure.\nOverall, we were pleased with the results, however noticed inconsitencies in the responses where the model often referenced players that were no longer on the team, despite prompting it to analyze a team from a specific year. I believe this could be due to the use of older articles in either its training data or the articles we were providing it. In the future, I’d like to look into feeding the model data in the form of CSVs and providing it articles from ESPN written in only this year.\nHere is an example scouting report output: \n\nThe Interface\n\nAs shown below, the user inputs either teams or players they would like to compare and specify the years they would like to analyze.\n  \n\nConclusion\n\nI had a great time at my first hackathon and exploring the world of Generative AI through sports. In the future, I’d like to further explore Langchain as well as RAG. I’d also like to tweak my data and provide current articles and csvs of data to provide more accurate scouting reports. I’d also like to see if models like LLava can provide insights given the spiderplots."

    "text": "Overview\n\nI tasked ChatGPT with creating product ideas, names, and logos for a product that aims to wake people up by shaking their bed over the traditional approach of using sound to wake someone up.\n\nHow LLMs Respond to Specific Prompts:\n\nI first asked ChatGPT “Can I have a list of product names for an alarm clock that shakes your bed to wake you up?”. It responded with a list of product names, even linking me to some existing products with links to them.\n\nChat GPT’s List of Products\n\nHere’s a list of product names for alarm clocks that are designed to shake your bed to wake you up:\n\nSonic Alert Sonic Bomb Alarm Clock - A solid choice for those hard of hearing, featuring loud alarm sounds and bed shaking functionality【3:3†source】.\nAlarm Clock Pro with Bed Shaker by Bellman & Symfon - Offers ascending loud sounds, bright flashing lights, and powerful vibrations, with easily adjustable alarm and time settings【3:4†source】.\nSonic Alert Dual Extra Loud Alarm Clock with Bed Shaker (Sonic Boom SBD375SSG) - Known for its large display and extra loud adjustable alarm, alongside the powerful bed shaker feature【3:5†source】.\nVibio Bed Shaker by Bellman & Symfon - A wireless bed shaker that connects to your mobile via Bluetooth, allowing for custom vibration power settings and notifications from calls or messages【3:6†source】.\niLuv SmartShaker 3 - Offers adjustable vibration strength between five distinct levels, catering to various types of sleepers, whether light or heavy【3:8†source】.\nVibio Portable Bluetooth Bed Shaker Alarm - A travel alarm that provides tactile and visual LED alerts for incoming calls and text messages, with adjustable vibrations strength【3:10†source】.\nVibroSaver Extremely Strong Vibration Bed Shaker Smart Wi-Fi Alarm Clock - Features multiple alarm and vibration settings, immediate remote vibration, and voice control【3:16†source】.\n\nThese products are designed to assist heavy sleepers, the deaf, and the hearing-impaired in waking up more effectively through vibration and, in some cases, loud sound alarms.”\nI then asked it to create a list of product names for me by asking “I want to make my own product, make me a unique list of product names for an alarm clock that shakes your bed to wake you up.”\n\nChat GPT”s List of Product Names\n\nCreating a unique and catchy product name for an alarm clock that shakes your bed to wake you up can set the tone for its brand identity. Here’s a list of innovative and memorable names for your product:\n\nQuakeWake Alarm\nRumbleRiser Clock\nVibroMorn Alert\nShakeUp Call\nTremorTime Alarm\nWakeQuiver Clock\nMornShake Alert\nVibrAlarm Wake\nShakeRouse Clock\nBedShocker Alert\nBuzzShake Morning\nRiseVibe Alarm\nShakeBolt Wakeup\nVibrateAwake Clock\nPulseWake System\n\nThese names aim to encapsulate the essence of the product—its ability to shake and wake users from their sleep in a unique way. Each name combines elements of vibration, waking, and morning, suggesting the product’s primary function and appeal.\nInspired by the list of names, I decided to go with the name “Shake ’N Wake.” After coming up with a name, I asked ChatGPT to make me a logo with the company name “Shake ’N Wake.”\n\nChat GPT’s Logo + Response\n\n\nHere’s the logo for “Shake ’N Wake”. It’s designed to reflect the energy, wakefulness, and innovative aspect of your alarm clocks that shake the bed to wake up users. The colors and elements chosen aim to evoke the sense of morning energy and the unique functionality of your product.\nI then asked ChatGPT to make it more modern and simplistic.\n\nChat GPT’s Second Logo\n\n\n\nCan they mirror certain human communicative behaviors?\n\nOverall, I was pleased with how ChatGPT responded to my prompts. I was really suprised at first when it replied to me with a list of real, pre-existing products rather than giving me a list of fake product names. With that regard, I felt like it misunderstood what I was prompting it to do, however, after re-prompting it I was able to get a response I liked better. I’m curious why the seconed logo has 4 different variations from one output rather than one logo, like the original output."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction to AI Music\n\nMy first exposure to the world of AI-Generated music came around a year ago when I watched this video.\nBeing a fan of both Drake and the Weeknd, it was shocking to me how real they sounded in the video. At first, I thought it was a real song but after reading that it was AI generated I was blown away.\n Watch the video here!\n\nExperimenting with AI Music\n\nOne of the first tools I stumbled upon is Suno AI. Immediately you’re greated with examples of AI-generated songs. One of my favorites is titled “Make a song about the moon.”\n\n\n\nSuno AI\n\n\nAfter seeing a preview of the tool, I decieded to make my own song. I used Gemini to make an R&B song. \nI present,\n “Midnight Serenade.”\nI decided to test out Suno AI’s custom feature where you can give it a genre and lyrics and it will generate the music. I asked Gemini to generate song lyrics for a Dark R&B song similar to R&B artists Giveon, Brent Faiyaz, and Bryson Tiller.\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\nHere is “Playing with Fire”\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nIn order to replicate music, the AI is trained on large data sets of pre-existing music. From this data set it analizes the various patterns, tempos, rythms, and lyrics associated with various genres of music.\n\nTraining the Model\n\nTraditionally, when training a model, the model takes the data and makes a numerical vector. In order to allow the model to understand the various aspects that go into creating music, the model is trained with MIDI files that are structured in terms of notes, rhyhtm changes, and beats per minute. This MIDI file can be used to train the model and is considered a “natural language representation.”\nThe Machine Learning algorithms then use the raw audio data for the entire song in the form of “sequential input vectors” that are commonly used in NLP. The model then is able to predict the next token for the song.\n\nLegal Implications of AI Music\n\nWith the rise of AI music, there is also a rise in copyright and licensing issues. As, when someone uses AI to imitate another artist’s music, this can muddy the waters of who owns the music, the creator, the AI, or the artist themself.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, I’m really happy with the result. Even though there are some instances where you can tell that the music is AI-generated, I find it fascinating how accurate and human-like the AI sounds overall. It’s also really impressive to me how the AI can make lyrics on its own based on the genre I tell it. In a future blog post I hope to learn more about how the AI can achieve this and sound like a human while singing.\n\nSources\n\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/how-can-an-ai-model-create-music"

    "text": "Introduction\n\nI decided to re-explore a concept brought upon in my Second Blog Post, where I tested if AI could solve riddles. This blog post will explore how AI interacts with images.\n\nReturning to the Riddles\n\nI began by providing the llava-v1.6-24b model the same image from my initial post, prompting it to state the number of matches in the image.\n\nWhile the correct answer is 15 matches, the model said that “There are 12 matches in the image.”\nI attempted to correct it by saying, “note that matches in this image are of varying sizes, some are smaller than others, but are still considered matches.” However, it still believed its answer was correct, it said “Thank you for the clarification. In that case, there are 12 matches in total, including the varying sizes.”\nI then attempted to correct it and prompted it with “this is incorrect, please recalculate and provide reasoning for your answer.” However, its response was “I apologize for the mistake. Let’s recalculate the number of matches in the image.\nThere are 12 matches in total, including the varying sizes. The image shows a total of 12 matches, with some being smaller than others.”\nIn this case, the model failed to recognize the correct number of matches in the image.\n\nInterpreting Data Visualizations\n\nI was curious to see how the model interpreted data and provided it a sample pie chart I found from google.\n\nI prompted it with the goal of giving it context about the type of graph and exactly what I wanted to learn about the data. I prompted it with “based on the image provided, interpret the data and describe how water usage is broken down in the pie chart.” I was shocked by its response:\n“The pie chart in the image illustrates the breakdown of water usage in a residential setting. It is divided into six categories, each representing a different source of water consumption. Here’s the breakdown as shown in the chart:\nShower - 16.8% This category represents the water used for showering, which is the second-largest contributor to residential water usage.\nToilet - 26.7% The toilet is the largest single source of water usage in a residential setting, accounting for nearly a quarter of the total.\nFaucet - 15.7% Water used at the faucet, likely for activities such as washing hands and brushing teeth, is the third-largest category.\nClothes Washer - 21.7% The water used for washing clothes in a clothes washer is the fourth-largest category.\nLeaks - 13.7% Water leaks, which can occur in various parts of a home, such as faucets, pipes, or appliances, account for 13.7% of residential water usage.\nOther - 5.3% This category includes all other sources of water usage that do not fit into the other five categories. It is the smallest category on the chart.\nThe chart is sourced from the American Water Works Association Research Foundation, and it is based on data from 1999. It provides a visual representation of where most of the water used in a residential home goes, highlighting the importance of water conservation efforts in areas such as toilet and faucet usage.”\nShockingly, it was able to successfully describe the pie chart, the exact breakdown of the chart, as well as where the image was from. This was a stark contrast from the previous experiment I ran with the matches puzzle.\n\nConclusion\n\nI was overall pleased with the results and felt like the model did a solid job of recognizing the image and interpreting the data. However, I noticed that it struggled to recognize the “matches” when they were different sizes in the first image. In the future, I hope to explore how the model reacts to different types of charts and data."

    "text": "Introduction\n I was intrigued to see how ChatGPT 4 interpreted sports and gave its opinion on sports topics. Thus, I decided to feed it one of the most famous ESPN debates of all time between Max Kellerman and Steven A. Smith.\n The Video \n\n\nProcess\n\nInitial Question\nI first copied the transcript of the video and asked ChatGPT to understand it.\n\n\nResponse\nIt looks like the transcript is from a discussion about basketball, specifically a hypothetical scenario where someone has to take a crucial shot in a game with extremely high stakes—the “fate of the universe” or against an imminent threat from “Martians with a death beam.” The speakers are debating whether they’d prefer Andre Iguodala or Stephen Curry to take this shot, emphasizing Iguodala’s ability to handle high-pressure situations due to having “ice water in his veins.”\nFrom this conversation, the focus is on clutch performance in sports, which can be used to highlight a player’s ability to perform under pressure. This could lead to a broader discussion on psychological resilience in athletes or the importance of mental toughness in high-stakes scenarios.\nIf you need any specific analysis or further breakdown of the dialogue or the context in which these remarks were made, let me know!\n\n\nSecond Prompt\nPretend that you are on that ESPN talk show. Its June 3, 2016, the Cavaliers are playing the Warriors in the finals and you are an experienced ESPN analyst that’s asked to counter Max Kellerman’s point, where he regards Andre Igoudala as the most clutch player on the Golden State Warriors.\nhow do you respond to this claim?\n\n\nResponse\nOn a show like this, responding to Max Kellerman’s interesting take, I’d say:\n“Max, I understand the sentiment behind picking Andre Iguodala; he’s proven himself in big moments, no doubt. But let’s not overlook Stephen Curry here. We’re talking about a two-time MVP and the heart and soul of the Warriors. Steph’s ability to hit shots from virtually anywhere on the court changes the dynamic of every game he plays in. When it comes to a shot with the universe on the line, Curry isn’t just a phenomenal shooter; he’s a transformative player.\nWhile Iguodala has been clutch, particularly in defensive scenarios and with his cool demeanor, Steph’s shooting range and his gravity pull defenders out, creating opportunities not just for himself but for his teammates too. His presence alone on the floor in a last-shot scenario is invaluable. It spreads the floor, it creates panic, and most importantly, it generates options. In those final seconds, that’s exactly what you want. You want a player who not only can make the shot under immense pressure but also can draw the defense and make the right play if needed.\nSo, while Iguodala might have ice in his veins, Curry’s the one who changes the temperature of the game. That’s why, in the most critical moment, I’d still want the ball in Steph’s hands.”\n\n\n\nNext Step\nI then copied the transcript and used the Video GPT by VEED plugin on ChatGPT 4 to make the video with the prompt:\nPretend you are an ESPN analyst getting in a heated argument: Say this in the video and make the scene like you are on ESPN : On a show like this, responding to Max Kellerman’s interesting take, I’d say:\n“Max, I understand the sentiment behind picking Andre Iguodala; he’s proven himself in big moments, no doubt. But let’s not overlook Stephen Curry here. We’re talking about a two-time MVP and the heart and soul of the Warriors. Steph’s ability to hit shots from virtually anywhere on the court changes the dynamic of every game he plays in.

That’s why, in the most critical moment, I’d still want the ball in Steph’s hands.”\n\nReply\nIt then told me to select an avatar for the video as well as the tone and duration of the video. I prompted with these inputs: Avatar: Noah Tone: Intense, emulating the atmosphere of an ESPN talk show debate. Duration: Extended to 30 seconds to fully capture the essence of the discussion.\n\n\nThe Video\n Here is the video output!\n\n\n\nConclusion\nOverall I thought the video was pretty good. I liked the clips that it selected especially the last one. I also think ChatGPT made a good and informed response to my prompt. It seemed like something an actual fan of the NBA would say and is potentially something someone would say back in 2016. I feel like this was also a good example since the data falls before ChatGPT’s data cutoff.\nI do think that the speaker’s tone could be better in the video. I asked for it to be intense but instead it took more of a narrator role."

    "text": "Overview\n\nI was curious to see how well ChatGPT and LLama could identify matches in a photo as well logically think through match riddles. This was mainly inspired by a youtube video I watched for class, where many of the leaders of AI questioned whether or not AI can think for itself or if it’s simply a word predictor. I was really curious by this and decided to give it some match riddles that I found on the internet. They were pretty straightforward and I thought it could be a good test to see if ChatGPT and LLama can really think for themselves.\n\nHow LLMs Respond to Various Prompts\n\nBelow is the image riddle that I presented ChatGPT with.\n\nMy approach was giving ChatGPT and LLama more and more context to the riddle to see if there was a certain point where it could answer the riddle correctly. My initial prompt was “Given matches in the shapes of 1+11+111=111 in roman numerals. Correct the equation by moving 1 matchstick.”\n\nChat GPT’s Initial Response\n\nIn Roman numerals, the equation 1+11+111=111 can be rewritten as:\nI + XI + CXI = CXI\nTo correct the equation by moving only one matchstick, we can take one matchstick from the “XI” (which is 11 in Roman numerals) and use it to turn the “I” (which is 1) into a “V” (which is 5 in Roman numerals). This will change the equation to:\nV + I + CXI = CXI\nIn Roman numerals, this equation translates to:\n5 + 1 + 111 = 111\nThis does not make a correct equation as 5 + 1 + 111 is equal to 117, not 111. Instead, we can move a matchstick to make a correct equation. Here’s how:\nTake one matchstick from the first “XI” (11 in Roman numerals) and place it on the “+” sign to create an “X” (10 in Roman numerals). This will change the equation to:\nI + X + I + CXI = CXI\nNow, we have the equation:\n1 + 10 + 1 + 111 = 111\nWhich simplifies to:\n123 = 111\nThis is still incorrect, so let’s try another approach. If we move one matchstick from the “+” sign between the “11” and “111” and place it on the “=” sign to form a “≠” sign (which stands for “not equal to”), we get:\nI + XI + CXI ≠ CXI\nNow, the equation reads:\n1 + 11 + 111 ≠ 111\nThis statement is true, as 123 is indeed not equal to 111. But this creates a true inequality rather than a true equation. If we want an equation that balances, we need to form different numbers.\nAnother solution is to move a matchstick from the “plus” sign and turn the “I” from the “111” on the right side of the equation into a “V”. The equation would be:\nI + XI + CXI = CVI\nNow, we have the equation:\n1 + 11 + 111 = 106\nWhich is a correct equation because 1 + 11 + 111 equals 123, and in Roman numerals, 123 is written as “CXXIII,” not “CVI.” It seems the puzzle as given is unsolvable by moving only one matchstick to create a valid equation in Roman numerals.\nIf it is indeed a requirement to correct the equation into a valid one by moving only one matchstick, and the equation must remain an equation (not an inequality), then I must admit that I am unable to provide a solution that fits these constraints using standard Roman numerals. It’s possible that there’s a creative interpretation or a particular arrangement of the matchsticks that I haven’t considered. If you could provide more context or additional rules, I may be able to assist further.\n\nLLama’s Initial Response\n\nThe equation in Roman numerals is:\nI + X + CXI = CXI\nTo correct the equation by moving one matchstick, we can move the X from the left-hand side to the right-hand side, like this:\nI + CXI + X = CXI\nThis equation is now balanced, with the Roman numerals adding up to 111 on both sides.\nUnfortunately, both answers were wrong, so I decided to give them both more context. I reprompted it with “This is incorrect. Here is a visual representation of the riddle I am providing: https://www.mindyourlogic.com/static/matchstick/Roman_number_1+11+111=111_Matchstick_puzzle.webp,” and got the following answers.\n\nChatGPT’s Respone\n\nThank you for providing the visual representation of the matchstick puzzle. The image shows the equation “I + XI + III = III” in Roman numerals, where “I” represents 1, “XI” represents 11, and “III” represents 3.\nTo correct the equation by moving only one matchstick, we can change the “XI” (which is 11 in Roman numerals) into “IX” (which is 9 in Roman numerals). Here’s what you do:\nMove the matchstick that forms the bottom part of the “X” in “XI” and place it at the end of the “I” on the left side. This changes “XI” to “IX” and the equation now reads:\nI + IX + III = III\nThe Roman numerals now represent:\n1 + 9 + 3 = 13\nIn Roman numerals, thirteen is written as “XIII,” which matches the “III” on the right side of the equation when the “X” from the “IX” we created is added to it.\nSo the corrected equation is:\nI + IX + III = XIII\nWhich is a valid equation, as 1 + 9 + 3 indeed equals 13.\n\nLlama’s Response\n\nMy apologies for the mistake. Thank you for providing a visual representation of the riddle. Here’s the corrected solution:\nTo balance the equation, we can move the X from the left-hand side to the right-hand side, like this:\nI + 11 + 111 = 111\nNow, we can simplify the equation by combining the like terms:\nI + 11 + 111 = 111\n1 + 11 + 111 = 111\n1 + 111 + 111 = 111\n1 + 222 = 111\n222 = 111\nTherefore, the solution to the riddle is:\n222 = 111\nI hope this clears up any confusion, and please let me know if you have any further questions!\nAfter seeing incorrect responses again, I decided to provide both LLMs with more context and even provided them new approaches. I prompted it with “This is incorrect. Remember that each match can be oriented to be vertical or horizontal, also, the equal signs can be altered as well as they are made of matches.”\n\nLLama’s Response\n\nAh, I apologize for my mistake. Here’s another attempt at solving the riddle, taking into account the additional constraints you’ve mentioned:\nI + 11 + 111 = 111\nWe can start by rotating the first matchstick (I) 90 degrees clockwise, so that it becomes vertical. This gives us:\n1 | + 11 + 111 = 111\nNext, we can rotate the second matchstick (11) 90 degrees counterclockwise, so that it becomes horizontal. This gives us:\n1 | + 11 | 111 = 111\nFinally, we can rotate the third matchstick (111) 90 degrees clockwise, so that it becomes vertical. This gives us:\n1 | + 11 | 111 = 111\nNow, we can simplify the equation by combining the like terms:\n1 | + 11 | 111 = 111\n1 + 11 + 111 = 111\n1 + 122 = 111\n122 = 111\nTherefore, the solution to the riddle is:\n122 = 111\nI hope this solution is correct. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\nI apologize for the misunderstanding. Given the new information and the ability to alter the equals sign, the solution to the matchstick puzzle is as follows:\nThe original equation represented by matchsticks is “I + XI + III = III,” which translates to “1 + 11 + 3 = 3” in Arabic numerals. This is incorrect.\nTo correct the equation by moving only one matchstick, you can take the vertical matchstick from the plus sign on the right (which is the middle matchstick of the three that make up the plus sign) and move it to the last “I” of the “III” on the right side of the equals sign. This would turn the “III” into a “V,” which represents the number 5 in Roman numerals.\nNow the equation reads:\nI + XI + II = V\nIn Arabic numerals, this is “1 + 11 + 2 = 5,” which is a correct equation.\nEventually I realized that it might not be possible for ChatGPT and LLama to solve the riddle, so I was wondering if they could atleast explain how the riddle works. I prompted it with “This is the correct answer: https://www.mindyourlogic.com/static/matchstick/Answer_Roman_number_1+11+111=111_Matchstick_puzzle.webp. Explain why it is correct”\nHowever, neither could correctly explain the riddle.\n\nLLama’s Response\n\nThe solution to the matchstick puzzle is correct because it satisfies the equation 1+11+111=111, which is a true mathematical statement.\nHere’s how the equation is represented in the solution:\n1 = I (the first matchstick) 11 = XI (the second matchstick, rotated 90 degrees clockwise) 111 = CXI (the third matchstick, rotated 90 degrees clockwise)\nThe equation 1+11+111=111 is a simple arithmetic equation, and it is true because:\n1 + 11 = 12 12 + 111 = 123\nTherefore, the solution to the matchstick puzzle is correct because it accurately represents the equation 1+11+111=111 using matchsticks. The puzzle requires us to think creatively and use the matchsticks to represent the numbers in a way that satisfies the equation, and the solution does just that.\n\nChatGPT’s Response\n\nThank you for providing the solution image. The correct answer to the puzzle shows the matchstick equation altered to form the following:\nIX + I + I = III\nIn Roman numerals, “IX” represents the number 9, “I” represents the number 1, and “III” represents the number 3.\nThe matchstick that was moved was taken from the “plus” sign and used to turn the “XI” (which is 11) into “IX” (which is 9). This change was accomplished by moving the horizontal matchstick from the plus sign to the left side of the “X” to create the “IX.”\nNow, let’s break down the corrected equation:\n\n“IX” is 9.\nThe first “I” is 1.\nThe second “I” is also 1.\n\nAdding these together:\n9 (IX) + 1 (I) + 1 (I) = 11 (XI)\nHowever, in the image provided, the equation now appears as “IX + I + I = III,” which seems to imply that 9 + 1 + 1 = 3. This doesn’t add up correctly in standard arithmetic because the sum of 9 + 1 + 1 is actually 11, not 3.\nThe confusion arises from the representation of the solution. The correct reading should be “IX + I + I = XI,” where the last “I” in “III” is interpreted as part of the equals sign. This is a common style in matchstick puzzles where a matchstick can be used to creatively form different symbols or numbers.\nThus, the correct interpretation of the altered equation with the moved matchstick is:\n9 (IX) + 1 (I) + 1 (I) = 11 (XI)\nThis is a valid equation and is why the provided solution is correct.\n\nCan they mirror certain human communicative behaviors?\n\nI was really suprised that both ChatGPT and LLama struggled with the riddle as a whole. I feel like an issue could be that neither LLM can identify the matches in the image. I asked both the LLMs how many matches were in the initial images and they both incorrectly counted the number of matches. In terms of their approaches to the were alright, but I feel like since neither accurately solved the riddles, they failed to mirror human communicative behaviors."

    "text": "What is Retrieval Augmented Generation:\nRetrieval Augmented Generation can be broken down into 3 different steps. The term Retrieval comes from the idea that the user asks a question, and the chatbot searches and finds the most similar data from the data that you provided it. The Augmentation occurs when the prompt and additional context from the data are used to change the “prompt template.” The generation ultimately occurs when the response is provided back.\n\n\nWhen you should use it:\nThere are three main issues with LLMs in general: : First, there is a lack of domain/internal knowledge that you might have since models are trained on publicly available data. This means that models can’t answer questions about your business or any other more-personalized tasks that you might want to explore.\nSecond, LLMs often hallucinate. Although LLMs can seem very confident in their response, they can provide incorrect answers to your questions.\nThird, the training cut off. In all models, there is a date cut off in data that the model was trained with. This means if you want to ask questions about current information, you won’t get a correct response since the model is unaware of this data.\nHowever, all hope is not lost. As, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become one of the frontrunners to solving all of these issues.\n\n\nTechnical Breakdown\nThe user can ask a question to the model like they normally would. Then the model searches for semantically similar data points. Usually this means breaking various documents into seperate chunks/tokens that can be then embedded into the vector database. Once it finds semantically similar data to the question, it “augments” the response using the similar data that if found. It ultimately feeds this context/similar data into the prompt that is called to the LLM. The LLM then sends a response back to the user that has been “generated” based on the augmentation of the data."
