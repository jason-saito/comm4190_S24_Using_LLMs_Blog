    "text": "Overview\n\nI was curious to see how well ChatGPT and LLama could identify matches in a photo as well logically think through match riddles. This was mainly inspired by a youtube video I watched for class, where many of the leaders of AI questioned whether or not AI can think for itself or if it‚Äôs simply a word predictor. I was really curious by this and decided to give it some match riddles that I found on the internet. They were pretty straightforward and I thought it could be a good test to see if ChatGPT and LLama can really think for themselves.\n\nHow LLMs Respond to Various Prompts\n\nBelow is the image riddle that I presented ChatGPT with.\n\nMy approach was giving ChatGPT and LLama more and more context to the riddle to see if there was a certain point where it could answer the riddle correctly. My initial prompt was ‚ÄúGiven matches in the shapes of 1+11+111=111 in roman numerals. Correct the equation by moving 1 matchstick.‚Äù\n\nChat GPT‚Äôs Initial Response\n\nIn Roman numerals, the equation 1+11+111=111 can be rewritten as:\nI + XI + CXI = CXI\nTo correct the equation by moving only one matchstick, we can take one matchstick from the ‚ÄúXI‚Äù (which is 11 in Roman numerals) and use it to turn the ‚ÄúI‚Äù (which is 1) into a ‚ÄúV‚Äù (which is 5 in Roman numerals). This will change the equation to:\nV + I + CXI = CXI\nIn Roman numerals, this equation translates to:\n5 + 1 + 111 = 111\nThis does not make a correct equation as 5 + 1 + 111 is equal to 117, not 111. Instead, we can move a matchstick to make a correct equation. Here‚Äôs how:\nTake one matchstick from the first ‚ÄúXI‚Äù (11 in Roman numerals) and place it on the ‚Äú+‚Äù sign to create an ‚ÄúX‚Äù (10 in Roman numerals). This will change the equation to:\nI + X + I + CXI = CXI\nNow, we have the equation:\n1 + 10 + 1 + 111 = 111\nWhich simplifies to:\n123 = 111\nThis is still incorrect, so let‚Äôs try another approach. If we move one matchstick from the ‚Äú+‚Äù sign between the ‚Äú11‚Äù and ‚Äú111‚Äù and place it on the ‚Äú=‚Äù sign to form a ‚Äú‚â†‚Äù sign (which stands for ‚Äúnot equal to‚Äù), we get:\nI + XI + CXI ‚â† CXI\nNow, the equation reads:\n1 + 11 + 111 ‚â† 111\nThis statement is true, as 123 is indeed not equal to 111. But this creates a true inequality rather than a true equation. If we want an equation that balances, we need to form different numbers.\nAnother solution is to move a matchstick from the ‚Äúplus‚Äù sign and turn the ‚ÄúI‚Äù from the ‚Äú111‚Äù on the right side of the equation into a ‚ÄúV‚Äù. The equation would be:\nI + XI + CXI = CVI\nNow, we have the equation:\n1 + 11 + 111 = 106\nWhich is a correct equation because 1 + 11 + 111 equals 123, and in Roman numerals, 123 is written as ‚ÄúCXXIII,‚Äù not ‚ÄúCVI.‚Äù It seems the puzzle as given is unsolvable by moving only one matchstick to create a valid equation in Roman numerals.\nIf it is indeed a requirement to correct the equation into a valid one by moving only one matchstick, and the equation must remain an equation (not an inequality), then I must admit that I am unable to provide a solution that fits these constraints using standard Roman numerals. It‚Äôs possible that there‚Äôs a creative interpretation or a particular arrangement of the matchsticks that I haven‚Äôt considered. If you could provide more context or additional rules, I may be able to assist further.\n\nLLama‚Äôs Initial Response\n\nThe equation in Roman numerals is:\nI + X + CXI = CXI\nTo correct the equation by moving one matchstick, we can move the X from the left-hand side to the right-hand side, like this:\nI + CXI + X = CXI\nThis equation is now balanced, with the Roman numerals adding up to 111 on both sides.\nUnfortunately, both answers were wrong, so I decided to give them both more context. I reprompted it with ‚ÄúThis is incorrect. Here is a visual representation of the riddle I am providing: https://www.mindyourlogic.com/static/matchstick/Roman_number_1+11+111=111_Matchstick_puzzle.webp,‚Äù and got the following answers.\n\nChatGPT‚Äôs Respone\n\nThank you for providing the visual representation of the matchstick puzzle. The image shows the equation ‚ÄúI + XI + III = III‚Äù in Roman numerals, where ‚ÄúI‚Äù represents 1, ‚ÄúXI‚Äù represents 11, and ‚ÄúIII‚Äù represents 3.\nTo correct the equation by moving only one matchstick, we can change the ‚ÄúXI‚Äù (which is 11 in Roman numerals) into ‚ÄúIX‚Äù (which is 9 in Roman numerals). Here‚Äôs what you do:\nMove the matchstick that forms the bottom part of the ‚ÄúX‚Äù in ‚ÄúXI‚Äù and place it at the end of the ‚ÄúI‚Äù on the left side. This changes ‚ÄúXI‚Äù to ‚ÄúIX‚Äù and the equation now reads:\nI + IX + III = III\nThe Roman numerals now represent:\n1 + 9 + 3 = 13\nIn Roman numerals, thirteen is written as ‚ÄúXIII,‚Äù which matches the ‚ÄúIII‚Äù on the right side of the equation when the ‚ÄúX‚Äù from the ‚ÄúIX‚Äù we created is added to it.\nSo the corrected equation is:\nI + IX + III = XIII\nWhich is a valid equation, as 1 + 9 + 3 indeed equals 13.\n\nLlama‚Äôs Response\n\nMy apologies for the mistake. Thank you for providing a visual representation of the riddle. Here‚Äôs the corrected solution:\nTo balance the equation, we can move the X from the left-hand side to the right-hand side, like this:\nI + 11 + 111 = 111\nNow, we can simplify the equation by combining the like terms:\nI + 11 + 111 = 111\n1 + 11 + 111 = 111\n1 + 111 + 111 = 111\n1 + 222 = 111\n222 = 111\nTherefore, the solution to the riddle is:\n222 = 111\nI hope this clears up any confusion, and please let me know if you have any further questions!\nAfter seeing incorrect responses again, I decided to provide both LLMs with more context and even provided them new approaches. I prompted it with ‚ÄúThis is incorrect. Remember that each match can be oriented to be vertical or horizontal, also, the equal signs can be altered as well as they are made of matches.‚Äù\n\nLLama‚Äôs Response\n\nAh, I apologize for my mistake. Here‚Äôs another attempt at solving the riddle, taking into account the additional constraints you‚Äôve mentioned:\nI + 11 + 111 = 111\nWe can start by rotating the first matchstick (I) 90 degrees clockwise, so that it becomes vertical. This gives us:\n1 | + 11 + 111 = 111\nNext, we can rotate the second matchstick (11) 90 degrees counterclockwise, so that it becomes horizontal. This gives us:\n1 | + 11 | 111 = 111\nFinally, we can rotate the third matchstick (111) 90 degrees clockwise, so that it becomes vertical. This gives us:\n1 | + 11 | 111 = 111\nNow, we can simplify the equation by combining the like terms:\n1 | + 11 | 111 = 111\n1 + 11 + 111 = 111\n1 + 122 = 111\n122 = 111\nTherefore, the solution to the riddle is:\n122 = 111\nI hope this solution is correct. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!\n\nChatGPT‚Äôs Response\n\nI apologize for the misunderstanding. Given the new information and the ability to alter the equals sign, the solution to the matchstick puzzle is as follows:\nThe original equation represented by matchsticks is ‚ÄúI + XI + III = III,‚Äù which translates to ‚Äú1 + 11 + 3 = 3‚Äù in Arabic numerals. This is incorrect.\nTo correct the equation by moving only one matchstick, you can take the vertical matchstick from the plus sign on the right (which is the middle matchstick of the three that make up the plus sign) and move it to the last ‚ÄúI‚Äù of the ‚ÄúIII‚Äù on the right side of the equals sign. This would turn the ‚ÄúIII‚Äù into a ‚ÄúV,‚Äù which represents the number 5 in Roman numerals.\nNow the equation reads:\nI + XI + II = V\nIn Arabic numerals, this is ‚Äú1 + 11 + 2 = 5,‚Äù which is a correct equation.\nEventually I realized that it might not be possible for ChatGPT and LLama to solve the riddle, so I was wondering if they could atleast explain how the riddle works. I prompted it with ‚ÄúThis is the correct answer: https://www.mindyourlogic.com/static/matchstick/Answer_Roman_number_1+11+111=111_Matchstick_puzzle.webp. Explain why it is correct‚Äù\nHowever, neither could correctly explain the riddle.\n\nLLama‚Äôs Response\n\nThe solution to the matchstick puzzle is correct because it satisfies the equation 1+11+111=111, which is a true mathematical statement.\nHere‚Äôs how the equation is represented in the solution:\n1 = I (the first matchstick) 11 = XI (the second matchstick, rotated 90 degrees clockwise) 111 = CXI (the third matchstick, rotated 90 degrees clockwise)\nThe equation 1+11+111=111 is a simple arithmetic equation, and it is true because:\n1 + 11 = 12 12 + 111 = 123\nTherefore, the solution to the matchstick puzzle is correct because it accurately represents the equation 1+11+111=111 using matchsticks. The puzzle requires us to think creatively and use the matchsticks to represent the numbers in a way that satisfies the equation, and the solution does just that.\n\nChatGPT‚Äôs Response\n\nThank you for providing the solution image. The correct answer to the puzzle shows the matchstick equation altered to form the following:\nIX + I + I = III\nIn Roman numerals, ‚ÄúIX‚Äù represents the number 9, ‚ÄúI‚Äù represents the number 1, and ‚ÄúIII‚Äù represents the number 3.\nThe matchstick that was moved was taken from the ‚Äúplus‚Äù sign and used to turn the ‚ÄúXI‚Äù (which is 11) into ‚ÄúIX‚Äù (which is 9). This change was accomplished by moving the horizontal matchstick from the plus sign to the left side of the ‚ÄúX‚Äù to create the ‚ÄúIX.‚Äù\nNow, let‚Äôs break down the corrected equation:\n\n‚ÄúIX‚Äù is 9.\nThe first ‚ÄúI‚Äù is 1.\nThe second ‚ÄúI‚Äù is also 1.\n\nAdding these together:\n9 (IX) + 1 (I) + 1 (I) = 11 (XI)\nHowever, in the image provided, the equation now appears as ‚ÄúIX + I + I = III,‚Äù which seems to imply that 9 + 1 + 1 = 3. This doesn‚Äôt add up correctly in standard arithmetic because the sum of 9 + 1 + 1 is actually 11, not 3.\nThe confusion arises from the representation of the solution. The correct reading should be ‚ÄúIX + I + I = XI,‚Äù where the last ‚ÄúI‚Äù in ‚ÄúIII‚Äù is interpreted as part of the equals sign. This is a common style in matchstick puzzles where a matchstick can be used to creatively form different symbols or numbers.\nThus, the correct interpretation of the altered equation with the moved matchstick is:\n9 (IX) + 1 (I) + 1 (I) = 11 (XI)\nThis is a valid equation and is why the provided solution is correct.\n\nCan they mirror certain human communicative behaviors?\n\nI was really suprised that both ChatGPT and LLama struggled with the riddle as a whole. I feel like an issue could be that neither LLM can identify the matches in the image. I asked both the LLMs how many matches were in the initial images and they both incorrectly counted the number of matches. In terms of their approaches to the were alright, but I feel like since neither accurately solved the riddles, they failed to mirror human communicative behaviors."
